I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I just felt compelled to. I hope that all of you are coping with COVID. These times are very hard and I am deeply saddened to hear about the numbers that are rising. Whenever I met Malaysians when I was travelling, we would always hang out and have a great time. We would share jabs at each other‚Äôs countries and talk about food... and we would always bicker about who has the best. Whenever the urban jungles of Singapore becomes too dense, Malaysia provides a quick respite for tired Singaporeans with beautiful vast tropical jungles. We were once brothers under the same flag and we have so much in common with one another. As your neighbour, we hope that all of you will be well and keep fighting to win this war. 

Please take care everyone. Looking forward to travelling to Malaysia again.

**29th November**

I placed an order on Shopee for a laptop Rm6K++Everything went smoothly. I checked the seller's status and their past order.Everything was good. I am confident that this will not be a problem.The reason why I check is that after I talked with the seller, he/she said that they have J&T, DHL & ShopeeXpress in their service.  It is very likely that this will end up being a ShopeeXpress.I made the order and sure enough, I got ShopeeXpress.

**30th November**

The seller dropped off the parcel at Sunway Pyramid.From here it was picked up and I can see the estimated delivery date was set to 4th December.I was excited about this new device. I was checking the status every day.

**4th December** 

Up to this day, there is no movement and no update. Usually, you would see something like ""Parcel at DDR sorting center"" or any form of the update showing where it is but alas nothing. I chatted with the Shopee Chat agent. They said they will look into it and in the meantime, I can press the ""Extend Shopee Guarantee"". I did that and the waiting game begins again.They gave me an RM8 voucher as compensation.

**5th December** 

Shopee posted a generic tracking update ""Parcel is being processed by the logistic partner.I thought ""Oh yes it is moving now"". The next day, following day, still no new update. It is still ""Processing"". Process what, I dunno.

**8th December** 

Today is the end of my Shopee guarantee. I chatted with them again. The update was ""we will expedite your shipment"", and ""We understand your frustration"" After I ended the chat, suddenly the tracking status was updated. This time with another generic update ""Parcel is on its way to destination address"" They wanted to give me another RM8 voucher as compensation.I said fuck that! (not the exact words)

**11th December**

There is still no movement. I chatted with them again. The agent said, ""I can see that it is on its way"". I was like ""Yeah, but where it is? Do you know?"" They don't have the answer but they assured me that they will ""expedite"" it. OR I can request a refund. According to the agent, I have waited long enough and it is now within my right to request a refund. I pressed the refund button. In the refund status, it was stated that ""It will take 2 days for the refund to be reviewed.

**12th December**

Suddenly there is a new status to Shoppe tracking. ""Parcel is being delivered to the destination address"" In my mind, I was thinking, ""this is new"". Usually, if it is being delivered it will be ""out for delivery"". Regardless I am sticking to my decision. Stay with the refund.

**13th December**

Shopee hasn't reviewed my refund request. I chatted with them again. This time I am pissed off. I gave them a piece of my mind. The agent now said it is actually 3-5 Business days and noted there is nothing that he can do. After the chat, he sent a follow-up email with Shopee T&C stating Refund Review is 3-5 working days. THEN WHY DOES IT SAY 2 DAYS ON THE SHOPEE APP??

**16th December** Went on chat to get the update. Same reply ""High priority"" ""Expedite""

**17th December** Went on chat to get the update. Same reply ""High priority"" ""Expedite""

**19th December** 

I switch from chat to call. Call them up. High tone, demanding an answer. I went Karen on them. The 1st agent hung up. I called again but told this agent that her colleague hung up on me. She put me on hold can come back and mentioned she will make sure I get an update by the 23rd. I demanded to speak with someone higher. This is her exact words ""I can get you any higher-ups you want but the answer is the same, you have to wait because no one in Shopee can help. This is a ShopeeXpress matter"" I am not waiting for 5 days and doing nothing. I now will try my luck with KPDNHEP. Created an account. Submitted a report.

**20th December** 

KPDNHEP emailed me back and told me that my report was too brief. Need more details.

**21st December**

Logged back into KPDNHEP to update my report. This time I wrote an essay, and attached all the screenshots of my order, uploaded their promise of 2 days refund review & their ""new policy"" of 3-5 days review.  Specifically told KPDNHEP that it is almost a month now and Shopee is practically stealing my money.

**23rd December** 

The day that Shopee promised to update me. Guess what. No update. I called them up at 6.50 PM (they mentioned the call center is closed at 7.00 PM. I thought good I still have time. Someone picked up my call. I told them to get me an update NOW. I don't care if you have to get your CEO, get me an update NOW.  She put me on hold until 7.01 PM then she terminates my call. I call back sure enough the call center is offline. Little that they know I recorded that conversation. I sent the clip to KPDNHEP and told them what I have been through today. It is Friday and it is Christmas so I don't expect anything to get done. So I let this ride.

**27th December**

 I received an email from Shopee. Subject ""SIASATAN ADUAN KPDNHEP"". The body of the email ""Hi Jafarul & KPDNHEP"" Sure enough, KPDNHEP has reached out to them, and now any communication moving forward, Shopee will have to CC KPDNHEP. I replied to that email with a summary of what I have been through and pointed out that Shopee themselves has broken all their promises to me and broken all their policies.

**28th December** 

My refund request has been approved. HUZZAH!!!!. They send me an email about it and as usual, they have to CC KPDNHEP.THANKS, KPDNHEP!!!

**29th December**

Now I received 3 Different emails from 3 different people from within Shopee, apologizing for all the trouble. At this point, I am just happy with the result. To hell with your apologies.

***TL,DR: -*** *Shopee did not entertain my refund request for almost 1 month. Refuse to face the fact that the parcel is now lost.  Raised a case to KPDNHEP, and within a few days, KPDNHEP got in touch with ShopeeMY and my refund is now approved.*

*KUDOS KPDNHEP!*

hcntgu,malaysia,1592665802.0,"Hey guys, I don‚Äôt usually actively participate in Reddit threads and discussions, but I felt I needed to speak up. I was a former intern for 4 months in World of Buzz and am here to spill the tea on this heaping pile of crap they call a ‚Äúnews publication‚Äù.

Without revealing too much (am using a throw away account because I am afraid that somebody from Influasia lurking in this sub might be able to pinpoint who I am with my main account), I was a, so called, ‚Äúcontent creator‚Äù. Only problem is I didn‚Äôt create content, I stole them. I was ordered by the bosses to basically rip off whatever I can find on Facebook in the morning when I reach the office.

Obviously, I didn‚Äôt join World of Buzz for its Pulitzer Prize winning news reporting. But I never knew how bad their ethics were until the first day I stepped into the office. On the first minute on the job, I was immediately told that I had a strict KPI to follow, 3-5 articles a day, and 1 video per day if you‚Äôre a video editor. If you remotely know how news reporting and video production works, you‚Äôll know that this is practically impossible. Hence, why so many articles they publish are basically rip-offs of some other news source. The bosses didn‚Äôt care about validity and truth, all they cared was views and revenue.

Many people like to pin the blame on the writer for the shoddy articles, but I assure you, none of it is their fault. I know for a fact that all of my former colleagues are passionate writers and journalists, they just got conned into joining a dodgy company who promised them freedom and creativity over their work, but was in fact nothing more than a copypasta blog. There was a period that many of my former colleagues stood against the unethical ways of reporting but to no avail, they were already duped into signing an employment contract and if you can‚Äôt hit your daily quota, you‚Äôll be constantly ridiculed by the bosses for being inefficient and be constantly reviewed on a weekly basis.

Hence, why my colleagues, once a passionate journalist, turn to summarizing and rephrasing news articles from Facebook. I mean, the bosses and readers didn‚Äôt care. They just wanted to get the job done and leave the shitty work place. I remember that there was a really slow news week, all of the writers barely had anything to cover, we constantly pulled all nighters for the whole week (without OT), scouring the bottom of the barrel just for content to hit the daily quota, coming in dead tired the next day just to repeat the cycle all over again, but what do we get for our hard-work? A complaint for writing ‚Äúboring‚Äù articles. It was truly hell. For the short 4-months I was there, about all of the writers of World of Buzz left or was about to leave, half of Lobak Merah‚Äôs writers left, and the lead of Noodou left. They had rather pay the exorbitant penalties just to get out of the contract rather than staying in the company.

The bosses often liked to remind us that our job was a luxury, we didn‚Äôt need to run around town like real reporters, and all we had to do was rip off articles. But for us passionate writers, we rather be under the hot sun covering real news, discovering something new and sharing it with fellow Malaysians. But what do the bosses know, they are nothing more than bunch of rich kids who don‚Äôt care about news, took their parents money, started a copy-pasta blog, registered it and called it a ‚Äúmedia company‚Äù.

Some of you may think ‚ÄúBiasalah, all Malaysian work place and bosses is like this punya."" But let me remind you, the people accused of such a thing are the few Malaysians who made it into Forbes‚Äô 30 Under 30 Asia 2019. Praised for their creativity and silicon valley-like administration.

I heard that since my departure, workplace culture has improved tremendously, but the culture of plagiarism and sensationalising issues still seems like the norm here. When you see World of Buzz, don‚Äôt click into it, don‚Äôt read it, it‚Äôs not worth your time. Punish the company with your indifference to its existence.

**Note:**
To clarify, I am not trying to incite any hate towards anyone. I sincerely apologize if I sounded harsh and severely vilified the bosses.

The purpose of my post is to expose the poor work culture that plagued the company and hopefully call the bosses out. Therefore, they can be held accountable by you guys, the readers, for their lack of journalistic integrity and poor leadership.

And most importantly, to clear my former colleagues‚Äô names, as they have been unfairly targeted by the public, who thought that such irresponsible news reporting was done so on their own accord.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/hcntgu/spilling_the_tea_on_a_malaysian_news_site/,Spilling the tea on a Malaysian news site.,,1310,225,1.0

And the most memorable part is that, we did it using democracy by voting similar to how we achieve our independence. No blood, no violence, all by a simple pen stroke and a purple forefinger to remember. 

They say it is impossible. It was, until today.

Take a bow Malaysian, we did it 'our' way.

From a liberal point of view, there is no downside to this at all.

The pros?

* Religion-based party wouldn't be as popular because people are now free to change their religion throughout their lifetime according to their belief at that time. (You know which party I'm talking about)
* Malays who opt-out don't have to be controlled by shariah laws anymore.
* No more fighting about Malays cannot touch dogs because ""Malay=Islam"" is no longer relevant.
* Easy interracial dating and marriages = Better unity (I hope).

I'm biased, obviously. So let's hear your thoughts on this. Also, if you have additional info on whether or not it is possible to legalize this, do share.

EDIT:

First of all, I apologize for the biased title. I was originally going to write **""Malays should be allowed to yadda yadda. What do you think?""**, but ended up with a non-question phrase instead. If I could I would fix it. I really mean to spark a civil discussion with all political spectrums because I know this is a question that non-Malays are afraid to ask, so all are welcome to comment.

The objective of this discussion is to have a clearer vision on the 5W1H of this issue. If it will ever be true. What is holding it back. What's the historical reason for this and that. What are the legal consequences. Etc.

The pros I wrote above are my thoughts because I'm a simple person who do not think far enough, so feel free to dispute.

~~I don't think this will go viral anyway so I won't expect police at my door tomorrow. But if it does, I'm gonna jump on that free publicity to promote my ig lol. (just kidding)~~

^(By the way, for those curious, my religion status as of currently is I believe in god, but I don't believe the personal-sin rules are really from god (like aurat, halal food, etc, so I don't follow those rules but I still declare myself as islam. It's my personal belief, I don't force it on anyone, so I don't want the government to force the islamic rules on me either. I'm not hurting anyone with my choices, let me do what other non-muslims can do.))",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/qmc9nt/discussion_it_should_be_legal_for_malays_to/,DISCUSSION: It should be legal for Malays to change their religion or be unreligious.,Religion,1249,565,0.89

I love you, but will you love me the same way too?

You love my elder brother more than me just because he was born first.

You gave him higher allowances, eventhough we did the same chores.

You paid for his college, while telling me to find my own way.

You let him make important family decisions, but you never listen to what I have to say.

You gave my savings to him, because you think he needed some help.

You gave him everything he needed, but he is still angry at you.

He derided me for working harder, because I wasn't given the same privileges, because I wasn't born first.

But I still readily lend my help to him, because that's what a family should do.

This is an important distinction because a the former litigates and the latter arbitrates. Take care everyone.

Monyets I bring to you an issue all of us know but none of us really talk about because of it's complexities, but mainly because it's boring as shit. I was talking with my friend when I realized she was woefully misinformed about the South China Sea dispute, and that's when I realized we need a more ELI5 way to present the facts.

I am no political science major but **I would love to be corrected** because this is the one of the real topics we should be talking about since China has been amp-ing up their aggression with their bullshit [9 Dash Line claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-dash_line). I will be providing as much sources as I can, and trying to explain this with as much colorful language as possible for entertainment. A detailed analysis will follow below.

So, while all this House of Cards political showdown in Malaysia is great and all, this is an equally important issue that all Malaysians should know.

**TLDR: China is doing some crazy shit and what's happening right now in the South China Sea is eerily similar to how Germany was appeased during World War II.**

[The South China Sea dispute in a nutshell](https://preview.redd.it/t4yc1nwrxv751.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=43b8e724c1d76229a9a6e13f2a08a897b0aefa17)

**The Claims**

[Just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eqtl0ym1p8) Basically, China made huge claims to the South China Sea and the islands within, on some [random and ancient](https://books.google.com.my/books?id=zc5ZAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false) historical grounds. These islands are important because of the [United Nations Conventions for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea)) and the [Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone) which gives countries 200 nautical miles of territory the right to do fun stuff like fish, mine oil and charge overpriced water activities for tourists.

The UN then basically [told China to fuck off with their bullshit in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines_v._China), when some international ~~high court~~ **tribunal** you've never heard of before (Permanent Court of Arbitration) [ruled against China](https://docs.pca-cpa.org/2016/07/PH-CN-20160712-Press-Release-No-11-English.pdf). This is important as the court consists of many members, [Malaysia being one of them](https://pca-cpa.org/en/about/structure/members-of-the-court/). China of course [noped out from agreeing with it](http://www.csil.cn/News/Detail.aspx?AId=201), and instead built [man made islands](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-flies-military-aircraft-near-scarborough-shoal-1468852659) and voila here we are today.

https://preview.redd.it/f5etn34pzw751.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=795f291c1cd4de2a66236216665bf89b9b4e5a76

**So why the US gotta keep sailing round the South China Sea**

So if the UN ruled against China, problem solved right? [Wrong](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-navy-sails-past-disputed-artificial-islands-claimed/story?id=60993256#:~:text=In%202014%20China%20began%20massive,they%20claimed%20as%20their%20territory.&text=China's%20new%20military%20presence%20and,provide%20stability%20to%20the%20waterway), because how a [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) gets territory is whether it [can exert its power on the territory](https://thediplomat.com/2016/06/south-china-sea-a-legal-analysis-of-chinas-maritime-claims/) [(Declarative theory of statehood)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state#Declarative_theory). [Might makes right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor#Indonesian_occupation_(1975%E2%80%931999)), and it's [also the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_declaration_of_independence) with a country's borders. Only if a country [willingly gives up power over a territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Peace_Agreement), can that territory be recognized as it's own. Now if that sounds really unfair and fucked up, well tough shit.

Basically, it's kind of like if you go out dating and your house is empty, if I can go in and replace your locks with my own, poof your bed is mine now. The US is kind of like the polis. They see me climbing your gate, but because they damn lazy to chase after me and do paperwork, they ronda-ronda around so I will think twice about stealing your sweet sweet bed. (This is probably a bad comparison)

So the US sails the disputed South China Seas on [purpose](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/us-china-step-activities-south-china-sea-amid-covid-19-pandemic), as a middle finger to China's power and thus 'legal' claim over the area. A lot of people here seem to dislike the US for one reason or another, even though [they are the only](https://www.fpri.org/docs/media/ChinasNavalRise.pdf) power [helping ASEAN](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/29/asia-pacific/us-aircraft-carriers-south-china-sea/#.Xvo3LCgzaUk) stand [in China's way](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/project-force-china-naval-ambitions-200102133749725.html) of claiming South China Sea.

**The Chinese Dream**

It's getting very important that [we start to pay attention](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sends-warships-to-support-malaysia-in-south-china-sea-amid-china-pressure-11589382717) because Covid-19 is a damned bitch and has wrecked [the world's](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/crisis-prevention-and-recovery/the-social-and-economic-impact-of-covid-19-in-asia-pacific.html) economy and will continue to do so. China might be [struggling with](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/china-wont-be-able-to-bail-asia-out-this-time) the [rest of Asia](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-companies-outlook/asia-firms-spend-less-and-save-more-as-china-economy-slows-idUSKCN1R008P), but they are [well positioned](https://www.sc.com/en/feature/what-are-the-prospects-for-chinas-post-covid-19-economic-recovery/) to [recover first](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/recent-releases/The-Economic-Impact-of-COVID-19-on-Asia-Pacific).  This is important, because then poorer countries [like us](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/world-bank-projects-malaysias-economy-contract-31-2020) that need economic recovery assistance will end up like [Africa](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/is-covid-19-enabling-debt-trap-diplomacy) or [Mongolia](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/26/the-united-states-should-help-mongolia-stand-up-to-china/) and fall into their [kanina debt politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy) which [**will influence us**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/08/27/chinas-debt-traps-around-the-world-are-a-trademark-of-its-imperialist-ambitions/)**,** with their appetite for for their ""Chinese Dream"".

So around 2013, Xi Jinping started coining the phrase 'Chinese Dream'. It's really just a ~~cool way~~ [propaganda](https://chinacopyrightandmedia.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/the-chinese-dream-infuses-socialism-with-chinese-characteristics-with-new-energy/) to combine socialism and capitalism, [daring the young to dream and contribute to the glory of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Dream#Economic_and_political_reform). Its kinda like the [American Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream), which itself was born out of shit like [Manifest Destiny](https://www.history.com/topics/westward-expansion/manifest-destiny#:~:text=Manifest%20Destiny%2C%20a%20phrase%20coined,the%20entire%20North%20American%20continent), but in reverse.

So like Wolf of Wall Street, [Chinese money began to look for shit to buy into](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Event/Africa/Investing%20in%20Africa%20Forum/2015/investing-in-africa-forum-china-and-africa-expanding-economic-ties-in-an-evolving-global-context.pdf), and projects such as the [Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) (BRI) was born. China was like [some angel from the heavens](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/china-xi-offers-60bn-financial-support-africa-180903100000809.html), [making it rain money from the sky](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer), blessing poor countries alike.

Before they knew it they were [heavily indebt](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-one-belt-one-road-loans-debt-by-brahma-chellaney-2017-01?barrier=accesspaylog) and [owing China lots of cash](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3040982/sri-lanka-wants-its-debt-trap-hambantota-port-back-will-china) for [shit they don't even need](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/26/the-biggest-game-changer-in-100-years-chinese-money-gushes-into-sri-lanka). Yes, in some cases [they lose more](https://carnegietsinghua.org/2018/08/16/china-venezuela-and-illusion-of-debt-trap-diplomacy-pub-77089) than [they hope to gain](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/7-15-19_Ferchen_Debt_Trap.pdf), but [when you lend out money like a loan shark](https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-much-money-does-the-world-owe-china), sometimes [getting your money back](https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/chinas-debtbook-diplomacy-how-china-is-turning-bad-loans-into-strategic-investments/) isn't [even that big a deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/asia/china-sri-lanka-port.html). [Kinda reminds you of KLIA, Sepang & KLCC huh?](https://www.aseantoday.com/2017/05/one-step-forward-two-leaps-back-are-malaysias-development-projects-too-ambitious-to-be-successful/)

**Fuck Get to The Point**

This kind of money [makes countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/22/china-moves-impose-new-control-over-hong-kong-international-reaction-remains-muted/) damn [scared](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3030991/malaysias-mahathir-thinks-china-too-powerful-censure-uygur-issue) to say anything bad about China because fuck it, who doesn't want to get paid? In Philippine's case, they didn't even say [much at all](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/12/asia/duterte-xi-south-china-sea-deal-intl-hnk/index.html). Imagine yeah, the guy who said [shoot all the drug dealers](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/20/rodrigo-dutertes-lawless-war-on-drugs-is-wildly-popular) now wants to [avoid conflict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=6EIlFtJrhsM&feature=emb_logo) despite having the most [advanced army as their ally](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/philippines-us-ally-china-investment/588829/) as well as the legal standing. He has even [rejected joint training](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-usa-defence/duterte-terminates-philippines-troop-pact-us-calls-move-unfortunate-idUSKBN2050E9) exercises with the US, and even allowed the same company that built the man-made islands that gave so much trouble [a contract in the Philippines](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/26/asia-pacific/firm-helped-build-south-china-sea-islands-wins-philippine-contract/). This is an ASEAN country at the edge of the South China Sea disputes, with people even [crying out](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/12/filipinos-dont-trust-duterte-to-handle-china/) that [Duterte lacks balls](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/3015601/duterte-coward-filipinos-opinions-president-and-beijing) and he can still be so relatively ambivalent to this kind of behavior.

If you don't know history, World War 2 (WW2) happened for a lot of reasons, but a lot of people point to [appeasement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement) being [one of them](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-britain-hoped-to-avoid-war-with-germany-in-the-1930s). Basically, they had [all this shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles#Military_restrictions) in the peace treaty from WW1 to avoid WW2 from happening. But Germany slowly kept testing the limits, and because everyone wanted to avoid conflict, they just kept [giving in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-German_Naval_Agreement) and [giving in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remilitarization_of_the_Rhineland), and [giving in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-intervention_in_the_Spanish_Civil_War), and [giving in](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/germany-annexes-austria) until [it was too late](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement#Outbreak_of_war). I don't know about you guys, but this same exact shit is happening once again, though yes, China is being very smart and subtle about it.

China is building shit all over the world secretly and non secretly and even [conducting espionage](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-usa/u-s-allies-slam-china-for-economic-espionage-spies-indicted-idUSKCN1OJ1VN). The only nation to actually take a stand against this kind of practice is ironically Trump's US, who initiated the trade war with tariff's on the Chinese economy. [Whether this](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-trade-deficit-how-much-does-it-matter) did more to harm the US [(most likely)](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55576) is not the point, but the fact is this makes US the only nation to actually fight back against China. Even the latest national security bill in Hong Kong has done nothing but drawn ""strong condemnation"" from everyone but the [UK](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-britain-johnson/britain-to-change-immigration-rules-if-china-imposes-security-law-on-hong-kong-johnson-says-idUSKBN23931I) and the [US](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests/in-broadside-against-china-trump-moves-toward-ending-hong-kong-privileges-idUSKBN23504O). (Whether condemnation is an effective tool is debatable)

https://preview.redd.it/9mi7o40bzw751.png?width=793&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2adbc0cf40c7211cb97718925d0ce299be7322c8

**In Summation**

So obviously, the US is not doing this out of the kindness of their hearts. Like any large power they understand the importance of the logistical routes that run through the South China Sea and more importantly the disadvantages of losing control over such strategically important territory. Given that they are embroiled in a trade war with China, one of the strategies they can employ is to put more pressure on China's sea aggression. ASEAN is the smaller power between the two, and while it would be strategic to let the two superpowers duke it out, there has never been a better time for ASEAN to come together and stand firm.

I don't believe conflict is inevitable, but with the strength China is showing and Philippines being the first ASEAN nation to so willingly cede control of its sea, it's definitely on the table. I made this post so that more Malaysians can be aware of the increasingly aggressive actions China is taking, as well as their less aggressive ones such as practicing [debt trap diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy). While nations are perhaps not as coy as I made them seem to be, they definitely perhaps underestimate the long term effectiveness of having develop both stronger footholds in the South China Sea as well as the development of the RBI. I can only hope that a simplified outlook will encourage more Malaysians to talk about this issue that is currently affecting our neighbors, but if left unchecked will definitely end up on our very shores.

**A Deeper Perspective**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1swzfwn6ex751.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=300b0a72f9b5d001d9e1e6f4cf5776e13836e984

This post started after watching a video u/stormy001 posted, regarding [US Naval Posture and the overall level of Maritime Security in Southeast Asia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=480&v=Ck2PFzp9obs&feature=emb_title). It's long, dry and winded, but I manage to summarize what I think is some of their key points.

**A Summary of Sorts**

2010-2020 is a decade of concern as US Naval power decreases relative to China's vast and ever increasing improvement. China is seen as desiring to cut US from their Asian allies in order to gain control of the sea trade routes. This goes hand in hand with the RBI, as China gains access to the Eurasian landmass, forging military relationships that they hope will blossom into strategic benefits into the coming years. The panel believed that the South China Sea (SCS) is core to this strategy, as they can ensure a constant logistic chain to supply efforts in the RBI and shore up their flanks once enough control in SCS is ceded.

For Vietnam, realities came into play after the [2014 incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Yang_Shi_You_981_standoff) when they had a 1 month stand off over a Chinese oil rig that came into Vietnam's territory. While no shots were fired, there was a definite show of overwhelming force from China that forced Vietnam to rethink its once calm outlook on the SCS disputes. It is also important, as China has actively interfered with ASEAN nations attempt to explore oil and energy within this region, such as the [Repsol incident](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-vietnam/repsol-says-drilling-suspended-on-vietnam-oil-block-disputed-by-china-idUSKBN1AI27D) in Vietnam and the more recent [Malaysia standoff](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security-malaysia/chinese-ship-leaves-malaysian-waters-after-month-long-south-china-sea-standoff-idUSKBN22R1SN). Both incidents show China's boldness in a world devastated by Covid-19, a fact that's been highlighted by [numerous entities](https://www.dw.com/en/is-china-taking-advantage-of-covid-19-to-pursue-south-china-sea-ambitions/a-53573918).

In the event of conflict, barring a historic change in the world it's hard to foresee that a US or US led coalition of forces would engage in a land war in Asia, underpinning the need for strong Naval presence. However, only Singapore is well equipped with a modern Navy and submarines, while actually affected nations like Vietnam, Philippines and Indonesia lack the Naval presence to even mitigate piracy and attacks from terrorists like Abu Sayyaf.  Indonesia was another topic that was brought up, as it was seen as a strategic nexus between the Indian and Pacific Ocean (Indo Pacific Region), and they have not been immune to China's bullying.

What prevents Indonesia from fulfilling this role however is Joko's inward focus, and fires that he has to put out domestically. Despite coming up with the global maritime fulcrum, a paradigm shift in how Indonesia perceived its status on the world stage, it has largely been put aside. Effective or not, it has enabled Indonesia to focus more on their geographical shortcomings, and building the important domestic maritime infrastructure that before was never really focused on. They asserted that Indonesia should however shrug off their internal focus and to step up its presence in ASEAN policies. Here they suggested the US take a closer look at their politics, and help shape Indonesia to fill this leadership role, in perhaps even a joint-leadership capacity like Indonesia enjoys with Australia with the Bali Process. Soft support could also be encouraged in areas such as the continuance of the illegal fishing task force or the environmental protections agency.

There are of course other realities that caution against this exertion of Western influence. For one, there is an alleged 50 million dollars a year from the US pledged to fight Islamic insurgency. While this has helped Indonesia make great progress, it also has given them an incentive to protract the fight as finishing the insurgents off would also mean losing 50 million dollars a year. This affects their priorities on their maritime security challenges, influencing their strategy to be inward focusing, specifically on counter-terrorism. As a result of this inability or unwillingness to sort their internal security in order, they lapse in their maritime security, forcing Malaysia and Philippines to demand a trilateral patrol agreement of their waters. This was a largely effective move, until June of 2019, when Abu Sayyaf continued their kidnapping operations. This in turn caused Malaysia to invest more into ESSCOM (Eastern Sabah Security Command).

This all comes to naught however when the realities of military readiness from all the affected ASEAN nations come into play, arguing that it's not so much a lack of will but rather a lack of capacity which necessitates US intervention. This forces an economic battle, which in turn is about projecting a nations capability to be able to prosper in spite of the pressure China may place upon them such as in the case of Taiwan. The loss of TPP severely weakened the US presence in SCS, thus putting less incentive on them to remain in this region to uphold any sort of prosperity or peace (keep in mind this is a US perspective panel).

**Final Conclusions & Some Points for Discussion**

I mostly bring this up because of some red flags a few of my Chinese friends saying to me. In essence there are apparently quite a few quiet but hardcore Chinese supporters here, which honestly kind of shocked me. They said things like ""finally the Chinese have a reason to be proud in the world"", ""there is no harm in having China exerting more political power in ASEAN"" and most disconcertingly ""I would welcome if China came into Malaysia"".

I am legit surprised that any Malaysian would feel this way, and when pressed on why they think such things the bullshit reasons they gave were no better. ""At least China won't fuck with your ability to make money or get an education"", ""For so long we have been regarded as second-class citizens. Why must we work harder to get on equal playing field?"", ""What China is doing to the Uighur's is principally the same as how we are treated.""

Now I have lived in China, and 1000% living in China is bad shit. They actively ban websites, there's this eerie sense of indoctrination from the people, you suddenly feel scared speaking your mind, since they have no problem making you disappear at the drop of a hat. Could things get better? Sure. But it seems that decades of racially charged politics has created a silent minority that I found personally alarming due to the steadfastness of their beliefs. I just need to know if any of you other monyets found more people with similar perspectives, and perhaps what your thoughts are given this has a very serious implication on how we perceive the geo-political realities today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/hibiep/the_south_china_sea_disputes_reeks_of_wwii/,The South China Sea disputes reeks of WWII Appeasement,Gemilang,1147,347,0.98

I know the rules has somewhat changed. Y'all seem a bit more strict on post quality these days but I hope this post is approved. Thank you mods in advance.

7 years ago, after dropping out of form six, I was working a dead end job. I really wanted to continue my studies but it seemed almost impossible financially for me then. [I had made this post on this subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/29doep/question_how_do_poor_people_manage_to_go_to/).

Update #1. [I managed to join a diploma course in a local private institution.](https://old.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/42t0co/poor_people_can_go_to_college_if_you_try_hard/)Update #2. [I finished my diploma. Took a semester off to save up degree. Started degree.](https://old.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/8577wa/an_update_and_some_remindersadvice_for_spm_leavers/)

And now it's time for**Update #3 (and the last one):**

I completed my Bachelor's degree. Did not graduate with a CGPA as high as I had in Diploma but decent nevertheless. I was hired at the same company I interned for in the last semester of degree. Been here for \~2 years already. I won't say how much I earn now. I started with RM3K basic (Software Engineering) as a fresh grad, which is not amazing but fair.

Despite the pandemic, I am doing pretty good now. Financially, at least. Mentally, that's a different matter. But hey I can now afford therapy. I am independent and have been slowly building up savings and making investments. I don't let my family determine my financial goals so no pressure to buy a car or house before I want to.

7 years later, I am finally done.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/nh7dva/7_years_ago_i_asked_rmalaysia_advice_on_how_to/,"7 years ago, I asked r/Malaysia advice on how to afford college and today",,1118,151,0.99

 I just married and going to have my 1st born child this feb. 

I learned my mistakes, and currently im still hustling to recover all my loss. Doing overtime and freelance. And right now my savings are around 25K . ( This is the whole money that i have in my life right now. For my family and myself. my wife is working too but she doesnt have any savings yet because she just started working ) .

The only positive thing are i dont have any debts/loans. Only commitments, a rent, nafkah ( money for my wife ) , to buy groceries and a few bills . And some money for my moms and lil bro.

I think it will take around 3-5 years for me to gain back the money that i loss ( 50K MYR). But when i get back the amount, the value will decrease due to inflation.

What you will do if youre in my place ? Will you start to invest again? Which platform will you use? Or will you try to find another way like building a business, or just stay with the 8-5 jobs and keep saving money.

***10 - 15 minute read***

For those who don't know, *kiam siap* is a Hokkien word for *kedekut.* In case you failed BM, *kedekut* means stingy.

This thread is intended for interns and fresh grads out there. It is entirely based on my personal experience and you may disagree.

I'm not as stingy as some of my colleagues but managed to have a high savings rate of nearly 80%-85% of my take home salary. I bet my stingy colleagues save close to 95% every month. Here's what they did:

**1) Transportation**

Owning a private car is expensive. If your parents lend you their old banger, take it! This car is not going to be a chick magnet but it takes you from point A to B. It's painful to see your fellow colleagues driving *God Car*s but you need to have thick skin.

Alternatively, combine old banger with public transport. That way, nobody will know what you drive and you get to skip the terrible jam, reduce carbon footprint, and get daily exercise. 

Most train stations allow you to park your car cheap. If you super *kiam siap*, park at a nearby *taman* and walk to the station. Pray that you don't get *saman*. Try to park indoors or under the shade to reduce car damage due to weather. Don't forget to put your wipers up!

You can look into the My50 or the My100 monthly pass if you are a frequent traveler. You need to do the math yourself to calculate the savings and determine whether it is worth it. Check the rates [here](https://www.myrapid.com.my/fares-and-payments/rail-fare-calculator).

**Note: Due to covid, a My30 pass is introduced until 31 Dec 2021. It has the same features as My100 pass. More info** [**here**](https://www.myrapid.com.my/fares-and-payments/frequently-asked-questions-faq/faq-my30-unlimited-travel-pass)**. So opt for this instead of My100 until 31 Dec 2021.**

In case some of you are financially illiterate, I will show you how to do a cost benefit analysis.

|**Scenario**|\#1|\#2|\#3|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Destination to/from work**|Kelana Jaya LRT to KL Sentral LRT / KL Sentral LRT to Kelana Jaya LRT|Taman Jaya LRT to KL Sentral LRT / KL Sentral LRT to Kelana Jaya LRT|Bukit Bintang MRT to KL Sentral LRT / KL Sentral LRT to Bukit Bintang MRT|
|**Cost per way (Cashless)**|RM3.00 & RM 3.00 = RM6.00 daily|RM2.20 & RM2.20 = RM4.40 daily|RM1.70 & RM 1.70 = RM3.40 daily|
|**x** **No. of working days (assume 25 days in January)**|x 25 days|x 25 days|x 25 days|
|**+ Additional days used (e.g. weekend shopping)**|Repeat calculation. Assume 0|Repeat calculation. Assume 0|Repeat calculation. Assume 0|
|**Total cost without pass**|RM150|RM110|RM85|
|**Cost of pass**|(RM100)|(RM100)|(RM100)|
|**Net savings/(loss)**|RM50|RM10|(RM15)|
|**Verdict**|Take My100 pass|Almost no difference. \*Suggest not to take pass for flexibility.|Do not take My100 pass|

\*Flexibility means sometimes you may fall sick/need to work from home and you end up paying for nothing. Payment is advance and non-refundable.

See the difference? This is why you should have paid attention during math class.

**Bonus: If you are still as student/about to graduate/person with disabilities.**

You can apply for a [concession card](https://www.myrapid.com.my/traveling-with-us/deals-promotions/concession-cards-for-students-senior-citizen-and-oku) that gives you a 50% discount on the **cash (not cashless fee)**. This card lasts for a year and expires a year later unless you renew. You cannot renew if you are no longer a student. They need a letter from your university/college as well as a person-in-charge for the application.

From Scenario #1, let's say we cannot decide between My100 pass or the Concession card.

|**Scenario**|\#4 (Concession card)|
|:-|:-|
|**Destination to/from work**|Taman Jaya LRT to KL Sentral LRT / KL Sentral LRT to Kelana Jaya LRT|
|**Cost per way (Concession)**|RM1.70 & RM1.70 = RM3.40 daily|
|**x** **No. of working days (assume 25 days in January)**|x 25 days|
|**+ Additional days used (e.g. weekend shopping)**|Repeat calculation. Assume 0|
|**Total cost with concession pass**|**RM85**|
|**Cost of My100 pass**|**RM100**|
|**Verdict**|Since concession pass is cheaper/more flexible, take the concession pass.|

**2) Food, drinks and snacks**

You can bring your home cooked food to work to save money.

However, cooking is time consuming and sometimes it is better to just buy cheap *chap fan/nasi campur*. What one of my colleagues did was they brought yesterday's dinner for lunch. It is still freshly cooked, saves you money and avoids wastage.

If you do decide to cook, you should cook something that can be frozen and thawed easily. It should also taste good since you will be eating it every day for lunch. You can rotate the recipes every week to avoid being bored to death.

What I like to bring is Japanese curry rice. I use [this](https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-beef-curry/) recipe. It tastes great and has most of the essential stuff (protein, fiber etc) for a balanced diet.

Glass food containers are recommended because it avoids bad smell.

Keep some dried healthy snacks in your bag like nuts, a banana or a Massimo bun in case you get hungry.

Bring your own cups and utensils to work. One embarrassing mistake I made as an intern was using the cups at my client's office. It was actually someone else's cup.

Also, note that most of your colleagues will likely be heading outside for lunch and dining alone in the work place means you may miss out on networking opportunities. In some toxic cultures, they may deem you as anti-social or ""not a team player"" just because you don't join them for lunch.

**3) Budgeting**

Always review your monthly expenses. E.g. how much you spend on food, entertainment, family allowance, clothing, insurance etc.

My advice is not to become super *kiam siap* to the point it takes a toll on your mental health.

I have seen some extremely *kiam siap* people whereby they rather spend an hour in the jam than using RM1 at the toll just to escape it. In essence, time is also money. The RM1 spent to save an hour can be used to learn a new skill that can get you a salary bump in future.

You should opt to allocate 10% of your salary as guilt-free spending like treating yourself to that Starbucks drink or that nice sweater you really want.

**4) Emergency cash**

Build a 3 to 6 months emergency savings in liquid cash. You can keep them in fixed deposits with variable maturity dates. This cash is not to be touched except in emergencies like health issue, job loss or other unexpected turn of events.

You do not want to be *that* guy who goes around asking friends and family for money. People will avoid you like a ~~leper~~ covid patient.

Emergency cash in your bank account also improves your self-esteem. E.g. if you hate your job or toxic work place, think of this money as GTFO money whereby you can resign without notice.

**5) Credit card**

Get a credit card immediately to build a good credit score. This may help you secure bank loans in future if you need it. Obviously, you should expect to pay on time. Never use your credit card beyond your means!

Most banks give freebies too if you register for their cards. Some cards give cash back monthly (capped at certain amount) so do take advantage of this. Do your own homework.

**Bonus: Method to borrow small amounts of cash at low interest rate using credit card.**

There is a way not known to many on how to withdraw small amounts of cash using your credit card at <1% p.a. interest. Most credit card companies offer EzyCash but charge >3% p.a. interest.

How does it work? By topping up money into an e-wallet that allows you to withdraw to your bank account. For example,

* **E-wallet:** Big Pay
* **Monthly top-up limit:** RM1,000
* **Withdraw to bank?:** Yes
* **Annual fee:** Nil
* **Withdrawal charge:** RM0.50 per RM1,000
* **Limit reset**: 1st of every month
* **Credit card limit:** RM5,000
* **Statement coverage**: 4 Jan to 3 Feb
* **Statement due date:** 23 Feb

The interest rate to borrow is the fee to withdraw. In this case, it is approximately 0.37% p.a. \[1 + RM0.50/RM1,000\]^(365/50) \- 1. This is only valid for borrowing up to the monthly top-up limit.

So how does it work? You must time it carefully.

**Step 1: Top up e-wallet**: Top up RM1,000 into your e-wallet using your credit card and perform withdrawal to your bank account. Do this only on the date of your statement coverage. E.g. 5 Jan. The money should be in your account account in 2 working days.

**Step 2: Prepare to pay your credit card**: Since you performed the transaction on 5 Jan, you only need to pay it by 23 Feb before it starts incurring interest. The e-wallet limit should reset on 1 Feb allowing you to top up and withdraw again.

**Step 3: Top up e-wallet again**: Top up to pay your credit card that dues on 23 Feb. **Only top up on 5 Feb although Big Pay's limit resets on 1 Feb!** This is to avoid the charge from appearing on your statement. Otherwise, you will need to pay RM2,000 by 23 Feb. Another RM1,000 should be in your account by 7 Feb and use it to pay by the 23 Feb due date.

**Step 4: Rinse and repeat**: Keep doing this until e-wallets reduce the monthly top-up limit or increase charge. Sometimes your bank may ban this practice because they are losing potential way of earning money from you.

Simple isn't it?

In this example, the limiting factor is Big Pay's monthly withdrawal. It may be possible to do this strategy using other e-wallets simultaneously. The next limiting factor will then be 50% of your credit card limit. E.g. RM5,000 limit only allows you to do this maximum RM2,500.

**6) Investments**

Try to invest every single cent you earn today so you can retire early. Life is not about work, work & work. You are not born to be a slave to a company.

Most youngsters like high risk investments e.g. cryptos, penny stocks or money game. I prefer the safer sure win method of boring *dollar cost averaging* into low cost ETFs for a few reasons.

* **Liquidity:** I can sell my investments tomorrow and get my money in 3 days. Very important if you plan to buy a house or get married in the near future.
* **Risk:** Taking high risk investments is silly to me. If you lose RM100k on some crypto, you need to work another 4+ years to earn it back.
* **Stable return:** If a particular ETF's 40 year long term average return is 7% p.a., I can expect my RM1,000 invested today to become RM14,974.46 (1.07^(40) x RM1,000) in 40 years time.

Most will recommend StashAway but I personally prefer to invest in the ETFs of my choice. It gives me greater control over my investments, reduce counter-party risk, and allows me to increase my return with the use of defined risk strategies.

**Closing note**

jr3wrx,MalaysianPF,1604948687.0,"1) Eliminate monthly subscriptions such as astro, netflix, water dispenser etc. Trust me, there‚Äôs nothing on cable TV and they are mostly crap interspersed with annoying ads. As for netflix, it is cost effective to share account with friends. As for water dispenser, i‚Äôd suggest you to buy water purifier instead for as low as RM100+. Why subscribe water dispenser for RM150+ monthly just to drink cold water when u can just chill filtered water in the fridge? 

2) Shop for new insurance. Especially your car insurance. Find a cheaper alternative. Maybe revise your current insurance policy and choose the one that goes easy on your wallet.

3) Buy used items. Never pay full price for things you buy at the store such as clothes, furnitures, kitchen appliances. I even bought a used espresso machine for less than RM500 so that i can save money brewing my own coffee for way less per cup.

4) Rent, don‚Äôt own. This one is subject for debate. I own a house too, but i dont live in the house that i bought. I rented them instead. So where do i live? I‚Äôm currently renting a 2-storey terrace house for RM1200. My rental property which is a condo pays me RM1500 per month which is slightly higher than my mortgage installment. The reason why you should rent is because i get it, houses now is getting more expensive. Besides, you dont have to pay for repair costs and taxes. Being a landlord can give you headache sometimes. But being a tenant, gives you a peace of mind. Save that extra quid for something else.

5) Purchase at the right time. Thats right. Buy when it‚Äôs on sale. Like lazada 11.11 sale. I usually buy my milk at tesco in bulk when it‚Äôs at RM4.30 instead of buying it at its usual RM5+ price.

6) Buy high-quality products. Easiest example is why buy non stick/ceramic pan that lasts for 1-2 years when you can buy a carbon steel/cast iron/stainless steel pan that can stand the test of time? Same goes to other stuffs you buy such as furniture, accessories, electrical appliances etc.

7) Barter. Trade in your items you no longer need or like for a better one. Like your current sub compact car. Dont like it? Trade in for another used 5 year old sedan.

8) Choose low-cost experiences. You know, like doing cheaper hobbies, budget travelling, fly economy instead of business.

9) Travel during shoulder seasons especially when going to 4 seasons countries. It is best to go during winter when you can find cheap accommodations and fares and fewer crowds.

10) Use loyalty programs. Make use of your loyalty cards goddamnit! Tesco clubcard, petronas mesra point card, cash back credit card with points collection. Anything that collects point, take advantage of them. You‚Äôll thank them later for redeemable stuffs.

11) Maximize travel rewards. Dont forget to signup for airasia big or MAS enrich points. Agoda cash is rewarding too.

12) Consolidate debt. Refinance your mortgage if the interest is too high. 

13) Embrace DIY projects. Do your own repairs. Tons of tutorials on youtube teaching you how to fix things. I even did minor repairs for my own car, my washing machine, laptop, clogged sink, pipe leaking. 

14) Skip spending more to elevate your status. You want to keep up with the Jonesses? Just dont. Your friend who just brags about buying an expensive car is probably struggling to make ends meet while you drive a used 5 year old sedan and have heaps of cash sitting nicely in your investment portfolio.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/jr3wrx/tips_for_millenials_living_frugally_without/,Tips for Millenials Living Frugally Without Looking Cheap,,191,55,0.99

Recently I started to read and learn more about financial planning and retirement. I realised that I'm far behind everyone that at my age.

Now I really don't know what to do, buy house first or save every single money to achieve my retirement goal. I can barely save about Rm500 every month from my salary after all the expenses.

10xnx1l,MalaysianPF,1675925180.0,"I probably need some advice, but this is a rant more than anything else.

**Background**

I came from a B40 family (parents were lab techs or lowly government servants). Growing up, we knew the importance of money and I learnt how to save from my parents, who would boycott stuff for years even if the price increase was just 20-50 sens. They would also tally income and expenses every month manually in a ledger, and they started channeling some savings into equities etc. Of course, properties then were lower than they were now, and so my parents eventually had multiple properties. 

My siblings and I were also pushed very hard at school (they still believed that the best investment was education). We had to be it all. Best student, athlete, you name it. What that meant was that all of us were admitted to reputable foreign universities. Unfortunately, I did not get a full scholarship, unlike my siblings. That won't have been a problem if I stayed overseas, since could earn in a stronger currency. 

Fast forward, I met and married my wife who insisted on staying back in Malaysia and in a particular state. For love, I agreed. So yes, it was my decision. But that has brought my family into a financial stalemate. Even after 3 years, we do not have much savings due to very high expenses - something which I would not have imagined to be caught dead with - having being brought up in a low income household who constantly drilled it into my head that ""it's not how much you earn, but how you manage it"". Summary below.

**Income and Expenses rundown**

1. We take home about 28k MYR a month after taxes. I feel that in any other scenario, we would have been fairly well off. My parents had far less than that.
2. \-RM5k - I am still paying back a study loan which was in USD, and it will be another couple of years before I can finish it. Even a meager amount in USD is insane in MYR! 
3. \-RM 3k - There are now 2 children who incur some expenses every month.
4. \-RM 2k - As my wife insisted in staying in one state, and I had to work in another state to ensure I earn a high enough income to support my study loan and the family. But weekly the back and forth commute adds to expenses. I have half a mind now to stop going back until we have a financial buffer, but I really, really love being with my small children and my wife also does not agree. 
5. \-RM 7k - Wife's general expenses. Although my wife was brought up in an even poorer family (uneducated parents who could only work factory jobs or unemployed), they did not espouse the same thrifty values. This was extremely surprising for me - I wrongly assumed that all people from poor origins would know the value of saving, but she was brought up where her parents were content with their socio-economic situation, alright in living hand to mouth, ""borrowed"" money from relatives and friends to keep afloat, and didn't have the capacity or viewed an importance to save. I am surprised also because she has a postgraduate degree. Most of her other family members were also contented with earning low and I believe it this mentality is now ingrained in her. So while our expenses are through the roof, she still earns a meager salary and does not seem to be able to advance in position or pay. 
6. \-RM2k - to my wife's parents. She was brought up in a traditional setting where parents viewed children as potential bank accounts.
7. \-RM3k - have to rent 2 places at once since it's in 2 states. 
8. \-RM2k - Food. 
9. \-RM1k - Other general expenses like shopping.

So I am asking if anyone has any ideas:

1. What should I do with 3k leftover a month? What sort of investments (non-bumi) should I take right now? I'm 35 so the runway has significantly decreased. 
2. What expenses can I cut? You may assume that most of what my wife expenses is non-negotiable (although I recently had a chat with her about buying children unnecessary stuff every week and she seems receptive to reducing that). I am thinking of cutting the 2k weekly flights. I don't think I can decrease that by taking the train or bus as my job is intense and I have no energy to spend 5+ hours commuting. I have also recently reduced my rent to live in a room with room mates, even though I am 30+ years old. However, I cannot downgrade my wife's rent as both my child and her parents (they don't have property) with us. 

Generally, I am quite disappointed with life. Even if I were in a high income high expenses situation, I wished it were because I have a mortgage - I don't even have a house at 35! At least that would have been money put towards a possible asset. I know comparing is bad, but I also constantly envy my siblings as they have multiple properties overseas despite being younger than me and are living comfortable lives in fat cat jobs that typical ivy league graduates overseas have. They could come home for a holiday and make RM20k purchases on the spot while we are leisurely walking around the city without blinking.

I made this throwaway account because my main one uses my real name (Who uses their real name on Reddit anyway? Silly, I know). Anyway, I need some advice on what to do with my money. (Not that I have a ton of it just laying around haha) I'm just wondering if there are other ways that I can make full use of my savings, instead of just letting it sit in the bank like what I'm doing right now.

A little background: I'm a 26 y/o Malay female, living in KL, working a full-time job that pays peanuts (But I don't mind because I actually enjoy it, the company is reputable, I have awesome bosses and colleagues and even with the super low salary, I still get to pay my rent & bills and put a cent or two into my savings every month.) Right now I have 180k in savings, **all parked in ASB**. That's it. That's all I have. I have no other investments whatsoever.

So are there other things that I can do with the 180k? Idk maybe take some of it and invest in something else? I honestly have no idea, hence why I'm seeking for you guys' advice here.

Thanks a lot for reading/commenting! :)

But many people don't seem to know what that subreddit was about, instead they now think it's a pump & dump subreddit, and r/bursabets seems to have been created to emulate that.

I have posted [how KLSE is different from US exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/bursabets/comments/l6s84e/difference_between_klse_and_us_stock_exchanges/) and why their topglov ""short squeeze"" won't work. Not to mention topglov only has < 3% short interest ratio as opposed to GME's 140%.

** It's a textbook Pump & Dump**.

r/wallstreetbets has never engaged in a group buy and sell before GME. It has just mostly been a subreddit where people post screenshots of their individual sick gains and crazy losses of their stock trades. They have never engaged in coordinated buying spree, pump & dump before this.

I saw some facebook comments, telegram chats, and people seem to upset by topglov's stock price.

Sorry fam, they conflated stock price and valuation.

Everyone comes to their own valuation of what the stock price should be. JPM thinks it's RM 3.50, but other analysts think it's worth north of RM 10 and more. 

Goreng the stock will not change its valuation, only its price. In fact if you are a value investor, you probably would like the stock price to be as low as possible, so the margin of safety is larger when you enter. After taking positions, you probably can expect some solid dividends, or hold like u/DeepFuckingValue until the broad market discovers its value. Until then, you just have to have enough conviction and hold.

Asking other people on social media to buy in your stock is not increasing its valuation, it's just asking others to goreng together so you can exit and let them hold the bags. This is unethical.

**Mods:** I hope r/MalaysianPF will remain like r/stocks and r/investing, a safe and rather responsible space for people to learn low-mid risk investing. Given the size of our domestic market, and how KLSE is inaccessible from outside Malaysia, I don't expect to see solid due diligence and equity research appearing on r/bursabets anytime soon.

r6zhx9,MalaysianPF,1638421609.0,"FD rates are currently less than 2.5%. Official inflation rates are currently around 3%. On the ground inflation rates are probably much higher especially in urban areas where your standard bowl of kuey teow is probably already up 50 sen from their usual price of RM6. 50 cents might not seem like much but when compared to the usual price of RM6, its a 8%+ price hike. 

This means if you have no idea how to invest, and just dump your money into FD's, you're basically guaranteed to lose your value over time. Yes, your RM10000 might be RM10250 in a year, but the 10000 roti canai's that you can buy today with RM10000 will probably be only able to buy 9600 roti canai's next year.

FD's are not meant as a long term savings vehicle, and people who use it as such are just burning their money. If your parents (or yourself) is freely able to withdraw from KWSP, it might be better to just max out your yearly KWSP commitment and get their almost guaranteed 5% interest/dividends. 

FD's are meant almost exclusively for a parking facility for emergency funds or a parking facility for funds which will be used within 6 months. Anything more and you're probably losing out on value and the banks are making money off your deposited funds.

Only wrote this post after i found out my parents had significant amounts in FD's for over 10 years instead of having it in their KWSP account. Their argument was ""KWSP might become insolvent due to the hopeless government"" but if KWSP really runs out of liquidity for their customers, the value of our RM is probably gonna be down the drain anyway. 

If you don't know how to invest, best start learning now or you're just digging a hole for your future self. Investments can be risky and you might lose money, but using FD's as a savings vehicle is 99.99% gonna get your cash value eroded over time. 

Go and learn (google/youtube/reddit) about what makes bonds, stocks, UT's, ETF's, robo-advisors, crypto, forex, real estate, and the commodities market work. At the end of the day, its your money.

Last year while still had the quarantine shit, I played Tinder, get matched with one scammer, who as usual use a lady photo. So yeah, as usual we go to Whatsapp talked 

As days goes by she said that she doesn't work full time, she said she get by by ""investment"". The investment here is some sort like the gambling website. So yeah, that time I was alone at house, and she said she willing to teach me about how she earned the money. I started small, about RM40 to RM50 initially.

Then we talked even more, she said she willing to go oversea holiday with me if we win big. And we talked on phone. Now all this while I had only listened to her voice and never really seen any face. I think the fact that I was alone that time and had nothing to do made my made this silly mistake of even believing that shit she was saying to me. 

One day, she asked me to go big, to expedite the earning via gambling. Initially I kinda reluctant, but after a few more sweet talk from her, I gave in. I will not go into detail, but the fact is that time I lost 27k in just one night. That 27k is part of the money I put in my housing loan. I had to withdraw it and lost it. Needless to say, I had sleepless nights after that incident, I just keep on thinking about it, talked to stranger on reddit.

While I study, I am on an internship that pays me RM1k/m. I also write and translate as my freelance work which gets me around RM500/m. So in a month I earn around total of RM1.5k. My expenses are as below:-

* Food & Drink RM200
* Groceries RM300
* Shopping RM50
* Transport RM50
* Laundry RM50
* Therapy RM65

Post 100k, we reached the rest fairly fast and it was just continuing the discipline, being ready to work long hours, multiple jobs and not being complacent, always thinking of passive incomes, other income streams etc. 

However after reaching the above figure of 700k and growing ( touch wood ) I am kinda lost, not only on where I stand and if this is even an achievement but more like how long and how much more will it take to quit our day jobs and completely work for ourselves, at this very moment that is not possible due to several reasons. 

Market conditions are bad. We don‚Äôt wanna start eating into our savings. This does not seem enough even 1mil doesn‚Äôt seem enough after reaching here. 

So question is if I wanna reach full financial independence by 35 (ideally) where do we stand with the above said.

I found one very good reason to not buy a house.  We feel like we can always upgrade or downgrade our place based on our income in case of anything happen. We both like that kind of freedom.

1. employee get paid because of the economic value, ur salary is not determine by years of exp. I've seen 20 yrs exp manager get paid below 10k. I've seen less than 10 yrs exp manager make 20k. So find your niche, skill and related experience, not yrs of exp in general.

&#x200B;

2. employer do business, don't fall for sweat candy when deciding to join any company. If business is bad, those benefits or even salary is gone, and u have to find another employer. sweak talk is just business language to lure you to make money together with bunch of other people. That's what a company is all about, a company is not a family. A family help you when you have trouble, a company pays u and expect you to work, it's a completely different entity.

&#x200B;

3. experienced employee need to plan their career, don't change job simply because of  1-2k better offer. Need to bear the consequence on ur job change. need to judge 5 yrs later will this company  make more money or not, that affect ur future salary / promotion / career progression. Joining a company is like choosing to buy a stock.

4. networking is often neglected, no high pay job in the job portal, because an industry has its own circle and boundary. The easiest way to get a job is by referral.

Life has just hit me so hard in the last few weeks.

Taking a loss is hard, but taking multiple 5-digit losses (in ringgit) in so quick succession feels so demoralizing and devastating.

 8. Do people favors. It's called Cooperation. They will return the favor, or someone will. No kidding. This really works.

 9. Make things-Look around you. Pick anything and make what you can with what you have.

10. Wear your helmet and put lights on your bike.

So, referring to the title, what am I missing?

At my age (late 20s), the questions of buying house start to get brought up every so often. Although I'm personal-financially conscious (keep track of my spending), I know very little about the economy in general.

But buying a house, at this economy? Post-covid, political instability, world events like the war in Ukraine affecting prices - my common sense tells me it's not a good time to buy a house or property. I don't intend to and not in a rush of trying to tie down a house in the next few years.

**Things I Don't Understand**

Instead, everyone keeps telling me ""*it's never a bad idea to buy a house*"". People from my parents' generation keep saying ""*property never goes down, unlike everything else*"".

My friends who have been 2-5 years in employment mostly have bought or intend to buy a house immediately. I have a friend earning RM4K a month with 2 houses, one in KL and another in Miri. I'm not making this up.

I ask around and never get any answer further than ""you can always rent out the house and get profit"" or ""Do you want to keep paying rent for a house that you will never own? Better pay for something you will own."" I never get justification further than these.

It seems like buying a house is such an easy decision. But I don't get it, I feel like I'm missing something here.

**Me Trying to Understand**

OK don't crucify me, if this sounds completely dumb. Absolutely no finance background here. The only thing I could think of was to go to sites like [Mudah.my](https://Mudah.my) and gather the prices and mortgages of the houses, and make another list of with the rent fees for the SAME housing development, calculate the average and compare. I repeated the same thing for several different housing developments. And from my so-called silly ""quick research"", the rent are almost always lower than the mortgages, except for some rumah atas kedai.

So how do people profit from buying-then-immediately-renting-out the property, as according to the ""you can always rent it out"" common wisdom? On top of the mortgages, they need to pay for maintenance and other things as well, right? And the monthly payment is higher than the renting fee.

**\*\*\***

I am really curious about this, although I don't intend to buy a house in the next few years.

TLDR: Where do I begin to learn about property and housing market? Not REITs or anything like that, I want to start learning the basic of the property market.

2. i- Sayang. Newly open today. The officer haven't received the official workflow yet. But in general, husband's monthly KWSP contribution increase 2% but it will deposited into wife KWSP account, for her retirement fund. There will additional deposit (gift) from government for those who opt this scheme. Not sure how much
3. i-Saraan. Self-contribution but different from one we contribute directly via bank transfer, you need to go to counter to activate this scheme. Then only during bank transfer, choose i-Saraan scheme. Get extra RM300 if contribute minimum RM2000/year (15% gift, rather than nothing)
4. i-Lindung. This one is Takaful/Insurance for Life and Critical Illness scheme only. Not medical card. Deduct directly from EPF Akaun 2. But the cost is very cheap, like RM200,000 coverage only cost around RM350/year. This one can get quote from website. I saw Prudential, FWD and Etiqa quotes.

I am currently in a dilemma between my choice for the future. I am currently working as an engineer in the UK, with a normal salary in GBP.

I have just received a very good offer from a prestigious firm in malaysia (investment banking job etc). However, with MYR as its currency, my job in uk still pays alot more than the job offer.

I am still early on my career, just graduated from a top uk uni last year. I was not expecting to receive this offer.

The way i can see it as
Pros uk job = salary is >12 k MYR monthly 
I like cold weather and UK culture 
I am on a visa which counts for PR in UK

I have been working on and off for the past 11 years as a writer and some freelance work. On and off because I live with a few mental health conditions. I don't know how long more I can work for in the future, but as long as I can work, I will.

Aside from the job inconsistency, my lack of discipline also contributes me to having near to zero savings. I tend to emotionally eat for example, so I order Grabfood a lot. There was also a phase when I would purchase a lot of clothes. 

I don't really contribute to the household expenses because of my dad's financial comfort.

My lack of savings have given me anxiety for the past few weeks. It is like I am finally waking up to the fact that one day my dad will be gone and wont be able to support me anymore.

I am starting a new job next week, and I will be paid RM5k, which is quite a lot by Malaysian standards. 

I plan to save 70% of my salary each month and stash it in a new bank account which I won't touch unless for emergency or really, really important purchases.

z2ebq5,MalaysianPF,1669174874.0,"Hi! I'm (21F) working as a freelance software developer working remotely for both local and overseas companies, along with that I have a sole-proprietorship startup (SSM) for a company I launched last year (\~RM80k balance in that company). Currently making around RM8k on average cumulatively through these sources. Getting paid directly into my bank account/Wise for all freelancing gigs, whereas the startup's earnings directly go back to business funds.

Very new to this but each month, I'm investing \~3k into ETFs, RM 1k on rent, around RM800 on living expenses, RM2k savings, RM1k given back to my parents. I also have a PTPTN loan (RM25k ish) waiting for me after I graduate, which is... fun.

I'm still a full-time university student & have no prior record of taxes &/or EPF. None of the freelancing companies I'm working for deduct taxes from their side.

2023 will be the first year for me to file my taxes, which I have zero experience in lol.

Separate from that, I'd really like to get a Credit Card to start building a good record/credit(?) for when I'm able to get a house/other loans in the future. But, since I'm still recorded as a student, I've been turned down for my startup's business current account, so getting a credit card of all things looks bleak. Even for Fixed Deposit Pledges, the bank officers said it's not promising as I'm only 21, with no full-time job &/or pay-slips. The guy told me to register myself as an employee and come back at 23 to be eligible...

I have just applied for another sole-proprietor SSM for my freelancing business, but am unsure what else to do...

My questions for friends in the MalaysianPF subreddit are:

* Do I have to have a separate current business account where I employ/pay myself for freelancing?
* Any way to get EPF/other related full-time employee benefits?
* How would I do taxes & financial accounting for multiple businesses?
* Advice for credit card applications for freelancers? (seeming trust-worthy to banks lol)
* How should I be optimizing my funds to get a better setup for the future?
* Any additional tips/advice/resources for me moving forward?

I am a 27 year old who has been working for 3 years with a net income of 5k a month, been fortunate enough to live with my parents the past years without paying any rent but I do have an existing car loan of 20k which is expected to be fully paid by 2026. 85k in savings with a portion of it invested into stashaway/public mutual. In a stable long relationship with my gf.

I've been scouting around for my first own stay home for almost a year now and have finally found one that I really like which costs near to 500k with HOC benefits, fully built by 2025. Booked a unit and proceeded to apply for loan applications. Managed to get 90% loan with a good IR from a local bank, expected to pay a monthly instalment of 1.7k plus 300 of maintenance/sinking fees. Haven't signed SPA. No co-applicants.

My only worry right now is the commitment involved, I will be married to this loan for 35 years and I am worried that the loan will affect my lifestyle heavily. I love to travel but the recent pandemic has put a stop to those plans. My family isn't really pressuring me into moving but would love to have a place to live of my own by 30-ish. My work allows me to work remotely most of the time which kinda removes the location issue. If I were to commit to this, I will need to make sure my income rises to ideally be above 8k/month.

11861xz,MalaysianPF,1676993288.0,"Hi all, I‚Äôm looking for some outside perspective and advice regarding my current situation. This is going to be a bit long. 

I‚Äôm 28 y/o, current take-home pay is ~RM4.5k. I have a net worth of RM246k (includes EPF, ASNB, StashAway, stocks, PRS, FD & money market funds) and no current loans. 

Monthly savings is RM2.4k which includes savings for retirement, potential house, sinking fund, general savings and investment. Monthly expenses is around RM1.5k to 2k depending on the month (this includes giving RM700 to parents). 

If I just had myself to take care of, I think I‚Äôll be okay. The problem is that my parents are terrible with their finances and have a lot of debt and no savings. While they haven‚Äôt directly asked me to start funding their day-to-day expenses (and their retirement), I know it‚Äôs inevitable, seeing the current situation.

I‚Äôm still living with my parents and they still owe the bank almost RM200k for our current house. There are other debts on top of that, but I don‚Äôt know the full details, I just know it‚Äôs a lot.

On one hand I feel like I should know so that I can perhaps try to plan for the future (since the burden will very likely fall on me), but on the other hand I don‚Äôt dare to ask because I don‚Äôt want to open that floodgate. My philosophy so far has been ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt ask me to contribute directly, I‚Äôll pretend I don‚Äôt know‚Äù because I know whatever I earn will never be enough to cover their monthly repayments for their debts, in addition to daily living costs. 

My mum is still working but earns less than me, while my dad has been out of work for a long time and is essentially retired. Both are in their early 60s and my mum is depleting her EPF very quickly and once that runs out and she stops working, they‚Äôll be completely reliant on me.

My dilemma is this: I can‚Äôt change their debt or spending habits, and the best I can do is provide a monthly sum as ‚Äúrent‚Äù since I‚Äôm living with them. I feel like I definitely should increase the amount since they‚Äôre struggling and personally I‚Äôm in an okay place financially (I think), but at the same time, they‚Äôre so bad with money that I‚Äôm afraid an increase will mean they will simply waste it - and tbh, it makes me angry to see the way they‚Äôre still so careless about spending when they‚Äôre drowning in debt. I suppose I can pay for some bills and debt directly, but I don‚Äôt want them to wrongly assume I can afford it easily.

So, I feel it‚Äôs better for me to hold on to whatever extra money I have and build my savings and investments so that I‚Äôm in a better position to support them when the time comes. Cutting them off completely is not an option, but I also don‚Äôt want to enable their bad decisions. 

Any advice? Your perspective would be much appreciated - I‚Äôm too deep in this to see it objectively. Thank you for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/11861xz/parents_have_lots_of_debt_and_no_savings/,Parents have lots of debt and no savings,General questions,74,78,0.96

qj8whh,MalaysianPF,1635622786.0,"I‚Äôve been following this Reddit community for a while now, and I have decided to have the courage to share my financial situation here. The truth is, I have no one else to talk to and my mental health is getting worse by the day, so I thought maybe I could start here by sharing what I had gone thru since the pandemic first hit our nation.

Just a little bit of a warning, this is a long post. So, here goes.

A bit of history, when I was in college 10 years ago, I‚Äôve decided to drop off college and pursue my entrepreneurship dream. I‚Äôve came a long way since then and 5 years ago, the company I have started with a partner of mine got our first major investment. Things were going great, there are of course ups and downs but we managed to get thru.. saying start up life is hard is an understatement. However, future was looking bright and my financial situation got a lot better. I try to save a large chunk of my income since being an entrepreneur, I always felt that my income is not stable. The hardship I‚Äôve faced also taught me to be fiscally conservative with every single sen I spend, even my wife thinks I‚Äôm overly ‚Äòstingy‚Äô sometimes.

Since things were going great, I‚Äôve decided to start part time study to at least get myself a degree this time (remember I had dropped off to start my entrepreneur journey). I did ponder about it for a long time but I decided that getting myself a degree would be money well spent long term. So, I decided to go for it, even if it adds more burden to my monthly commitment to paying university fees.

Then one day the infamous Covid-19 pandemic hits our nation and everything starts crumbling apart fast. A series of event had occurred to me, so I tried to summarize to keep it short and they have been slowly and gradually degrading my mental health..

Event 1: My investors decided to pull off our funding to my company as soon as the pandemic hit the economy real bad. That left my company with only a few months of reserves to stay afloat.

Event 2: I stop taking salary for myself so that I can pay my staffs and expenses in the company due to Event 1, so I have literally no income (for more than a year now since the pandemic).

Event 3: My house which I have down payment 4 years ago had VP last year, adding more burden to my already growing monthly commitments.

Event 4: I had to secure a ‚Äòloan shark‚Äô fund with another investor to pull my company thru. At this point, I had no other choice but to accept the fund. It‚Äôs meant to be keep us afloat while I try to secure a larger funding with other potential investors. But the fund depleted and I was not able to secure larger fund due to series of lockdowns and many investors felt very unpredictable about our nation‚Äôs economy.

Event 5: Adding to the increasing problems I‚Äôm facing, my dad business was also badly affected since the pandemic and he had to take up many loans to keep the business afloat. So my dad business had to take a gamble and pivot to something new. This something new has starting to take shape, but my dad is in the verge of bankruptcy - is either bankruptcy first or the business succeed first at this point. Bankruptcy would lead my parents and my siblings homeless. This is my biggest source of my depression.

Event 6: the investor who I‚Äôve secured a ‚Äòloan shark‚Äô funding with, threaten to sue my company while I‚Äôm trying to secure larger funds with potential investors. I‚Äôve managed to de-escalate the situation but it won‚Äôt last long.

At this point, I‚Äôve depleted my savings by a huge margin trying to keep the company afloat and paying my on-going commitments.

Now I‚Äôm left with just enough savings for me to survive on my own for a year. If my dad situation isn‚Äôt improving, my runway might be significantly shorter (maybe a month or two).

Now if I think back of the many mistakes I did since the pandemic, I think of what I could have done differently to not put myself in this situation, and this drives me to depression.

Mistake 1: Overly confident on the future, did not prepare enough for contingency, even if such event is very unlikely. The pandemic is something no logical person could have thought of. When such event happened, everything could just fall apart, and they fall apart quickly.

Mistake 2: Taking up commitments without due consideration when times are good. Incomes are unpredictable. Commitments (expenses) are more likely to grow as your finances improve. It is easy to fall into this trap. Shit can happen anytime.

Mistake 3: Not having a degree. I know this is a sad reality, but nobody is going to take you seriously if you do not have a degree, unless you have a successful running business (which I do not have anymore). A degree is a safety net.

Mistake 4: Turning down a less riskier offer. I‚Äôve been offered a high paying job but I turned it down because I still believe my company could be brought back up again. I decided to gamble and it eventually costed me.

So now I‚Äôm here stuck in these situations and I‚Äôm not sure what to do now. I could not sleep well, and it‚Äôs hard for me to make logical decisions anymore. Currently, I‚Äôm talking to companies to acquire my company for cheap, it has made some progress but it is still uncertain.

Should I just leave all this behind and try look for a job? Or should I just continue trying to save the company?

Again, I apologize for such a long post.

I am in need of guidance in almost all aspects of PF. Let me provide some background. 

I am M32, with almost no PF knowledge and practice. For most of my life, I lived in a lesser state imposed by the people around me and eventually I did it to myself too. My upbringing was extremely restricted and I wasn't taught many things about living as a valuable human being, much less how to finance my existence. So, I convinced myself that my life was worthless, and I've made attempts to end things before. But I'm changed and changing, moving forward. 
I now want to add value to my life and down the line, my community too,  once I have created that life of value and fulfillment
.
 I recently got a corporate role as an executive taking home about RM2.5k, with basically no savings or investments or insurance. I have a room in a home which I currently do not pay for (for which I am grateful) and my monthly expenses come up to about RM1.5k which includes medical expenses, car expenses, food and other miscellaneous things. 

I'm not even sure what exactly I need to know and practice in order to build wealth and sustain it right now, but I'm willing to do (almost) anything it takes with the right guidance and blueprint. 

I would truly appreciate your responses on this. Please pardon my humble personage, I'm basically a blank slate at this point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/112olzn/a_blank_slate/,A Blank Slate,General questions,72,23,1.0

Here are some I can think of:

* Scholarships available for Malaysians
* Local and foreign brokerages assessible to Malaysians
* Useful Malaysian websites
* Not-really-worth-it investments
* Sending money overseas
* In-depth guides (*e.g. opening SG bank account as a Malaysian*)
* Filing taxes/Tax FAQ (*hopefully there is a tax expert here*)

**We'd love to hear what you guys think.**

Other ideas:

* Monthly deals/promo/referral code thread (*E.g. Sale in One Utama, coupons worth sharing)*
* Discord

This thread also serves as a **tiny AMA**. So, feel free to ask me questions about myself.

**Do share with us** some of your ideas and **which ideas you think we should implement**.

I dropped out of uni at 25 due to some personal mental health issues and have just been doing random jobs like working at cafes part time etc. I am grateful to have a supportive family whom I live with so I dont pay rent and i dont incur much questions. 

Due to my mental health issues of the past, Ive never really had the hustle drive, the desire to work hard and make a name for myself/ achieve anything. I would say I was more of a 'take one day at a time', super chilled person. 

However, over the past 2 years, something in me changed. Its like my brain just flipped and I have become very motivated to work hard, and to achieve my set goals. I have enrolled in uni now, doing a Bachelors in Business Admin and im currently in my 2nd year, both working and studying full time. Its been insanely difficult, juggling both but i am determined to graduate in 3 years and I dont wanna waste anymore time. I am currently working full time in a family business as an admin/ operations in the service industry. Job and pay is good but i feel.. dissatisfied as I feel I have reached the peak of my learning curve there. 

The question I have is .. What would my job prospects be like when I graduate? When I graduate, I will be 30 years old. I am also studying my degree at some random private uni cause the fees are decently affordable but there is no name to it / quality. In securing a job after graduation, would it matter which uni i graduated from? I just really have no idea what to expect or what to do. I am willing to work hard and make something of my life now. If i were to apply to a big firm, would they even consider me due to my age and experience? Have I screwed up my life by messing up in my early 20's? I really feel like a failure now, seeing my friends and peers do so well in life. Will I ever be able to catch up and make something of myself? :/ Sigh. I need some.. motivation.

\- Short-term investments for monthly dividends (US ETFs)

\- How can I grow into a 5-figure monthly/annual income through dividends with only RM2000 a month?

\- Since I'm working from home and living with family currently, I'm taking a risky option of investing so far all of my salary on Bursa stocks and US ETFs, is that a good thing or are there any alternatives?

\- What are the key aspects I need to look for besides the dividend payout amount and the dividend yield? I am aware that high DY doesn't mean I'll get huge payouts.

The amount is surprising as my family has always been very normal therefore I never expected this amount as I always thought maximum my mom would have is 100k. Also, I'm the only child and my dad is living off 3k monthly pension transferred to his name from the passing of my mom.

What I got: 
1. 10k in emergency funds
2. 275k in FD
3. 380k in Unit trust (Pays about 1.5k a month in dividends which I am not sure whether to let it roll or use it as my daily expense)
4. 180k in ASM/ASB (I'm not bumi so the other version)
5. 300g+ in gold necklaces,rings, bracelets (Yeah I actually weighted it cause my dad insist in keeping it at home and I want to force him to put in a safe instead)
6. House in my name (600k+ Value)
7. There are other investments not in the will so the lawyer is still checking with the department of I'm not sure what.

I recently purchased a house around 400k zero deposit and monthly payment is 1.6k shared with my gf. I have a car which is 300 a month commitment other than that nothing else.

tjyj90,MalaysianPF,1647938981.0,"So, my parents shared this TikTok video [https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSdLeBMAb/](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSdLeBMAb/) to family WhatsApp group. 

Parents are getting older and I think there's an expectation to care for them.

And for someone who also believes in putting in the extra miles for career, it starts to feel that these two objectives of progressing in career and caring for parents can be somewhat hard to manage.

In an ideal world, this should have been easy. Caring for your own parents should be the number one priority. They brought you up, gave you the education that enabled you to be where you are at today.

But the reality is, we still need to make ends meet. Caring for elderly is not cheap, and that does not even include taking care of your own small family (child education, childcare, wife, self investment in health, education, savings, etc).

Not to mention that our parents may also expect certain level of comfort relative to our own lifestyle. For example, say I'm earning RM5k per month, which provides certain lifestyle to my kids and family, and somehow my parents would expect the same for them.

Parents expectation is we are always there to care for them. But work may sometimes ask you to travel, to put in the extra hours, or simply just to work your 9-5.

Send them to nursing home? Two parents can raise 8 children but 8 children can't even take care of their two parents? How do you respond to that without being emotional?

This makes me thing how I want to settle down in my old age. Do I want to burden my kids or create ""some"" expectations for them to care for me?

Fundamentally I believe in caring for our elderly, and of course my own parents. But I also feel some expectations from my own parents that makes me feel guilty to pursue my career.

On the other hand, they would also be proud to know if their children are doing well in their career.

And it doesn't help when some religious preachers would go on and give ideas to them on how it's better to have their children working at a carwash, become a carpenter, dishwasher and have time to care for their parents instead of having their children working as a director, MNC CEO, busy traveling here and there and have no time to care for their own parents.

yuqy1y,MalaysianPF,1668407141.0,"Hi everyone, I am turning 24 and just graduated from university with a degree in real estate I was forced to take by my parents. But am fortunate enough to have made RM450K (Not parent's money, read on!)

During studying this program, the schedule was flexible, and I took it as an opportunity to start an online business. After multiple failed attempts and almost losing my savings. I was able to create an online business and hired two people to help out. The business was never funded by any investors not even family members

The pandemic then hit, and initially, I thought the business would go bust. But, the opposite happened, business was roaring, and we could not keep up with demand. At one point, I made RM 20K per month. After MCO ended though, the business has been dropping, our product line is also aging, and the online marketplace is now a lot more competitive than when we started.

My dad has constantly discouraged me from continuing on with the business and discouraging me from renting an office. And saying this business is not 'Long term' and constantly talking bad about our products and say we are harming people when we just sell gadgets online. Even at our peak he discourages me. I listen to his advice because he has found success financially but now feel like 80% of his advice is not beneficial.

He told me instead to pursue my real estate license, which will allow me to open up my own real estate brokerage firm or partner with other agents and collect monthly passive income of around RM3.5K per month; in order to get the license, I had to finish a diploma and a degree, he said it was an 'easy course' and getting the license would be easy. Before this he would constantly discourage me from going to college or university altogether even though I had good grades.

I now regret using 5 years of my academic life pursuing this diploma & degree as I honestly felt I learned nothing of much value and getting the license is not easy and will require me to practice as a real estate agent for 2 years, write logbooks, complete multiple complex task and go for an interview with the board of estate agents. I interned as a real estate agent and hate working with other agents due to their sleazy tactics and disregard for clients. They will blatantly lie to clients to get a sale. Pay is also 100% commission based and competition is also super high as everyone is an agent now.

The passing rate of getting the license is only 7% per year as the interview is incredibly difficult and there are not much guides to refer to. At this rate I will need 3.5 years to get the license or more. Some students never get the license.

But I do feel blessed that my online business was able to generate RM450K in net profit and I have saved 100% of the profits as I did not splurge on anything. I am unsure of what to do with this cash now as my business is dropping and parents highly discourage me from continuing the business (I still live with my parents), and uncertain market condition. I want to continue running the business but with falling sales and staff who want to explore different career paths, it is difficult

I have been thinking of taking a degree or masters in computer science as I heard the pay is good and I like computers in general especially Ai & Machine learning. I see the future heading there. As I don't see a long term future of me working as a real estate agent and I feel the industry will soon be disrupted . But completing this studies will take me another 3 years and I am unsure if tech companies want a 27 year old graduate for computer science.

I don't think my parents are bad and are trying their best to ensure I have a good future. But I don't think they are aware of my situation and goals I just give advice with little research and regard now.

My goal is to have financial freedom by the age of 30

Edit2: I have seen many people asking me to keep it in EPF and while it is ok, I just prefer the flexibility of being able to withdraw my money whenever and not being locked until I'm 55. I'm still too young and anything could happen when I might need that money.

Hi, I'm 19F and I'm using a throwaway account for privacy and safety purposes. I'm typing this on a phone too, so sorry for the formating.

yktpsq,MalaysianPF,1667454877.0,"27, potentially going into my first proper job as an engineer soon. Yes I know I'm really late to the game and I need to do some catching up.


Pay will be around RM2.8k-3k a month and I honestly don't see it increasing much in the next 2 years. 
I plan on driving Grab on weekends and can make around 1.5k a month. In an ideal world, I would be earning up to RM100k in 2 years including EPF and save up to RM60k.


But this is where I'm a bit confused. Please bare with me as I go through all the numbers to justify my thought process. A few months ago I applied for a Working Holiday Visa (WHV) to Australia. I can stay up to 3 years with this visa (renewed yearly). Wages in Australia are incredibly high (so are the cost of living) and regular jobs like waiter or bartenders get a standard rate of $26 per hour. Working 8 hour shifts 5 days a week for 50 weeks I can earn AUD $44k after tax. Assuming I spend 40% on living expenses, it still leaves me with AUD 26k (RM80k) to save in just one year. This is a conservative figure. It's easily possible to SAVE more than RM100k if I work weekends or do overtime. My initial thought process was to use this as an opportunity to study cybersecurity on my free time while working. Get a couple of online certifications like CISSP, CompTIA, CISM. 

So I'm at the point in life where I'm expected to have a stable career and possibility get married in the 5 years. If I stay in Malaysia I'm able to save very little but I'll be gaining valuable experience and information as an engineer, stay near family and live a very typical life. There is even a small possiblity of moving overseas after gaining enough experience down the line. I understand this is the safer and 'mature' path.

If I go to Australia it will be a incredible experience being able to do so many bucket list things while I'm still young (something I'll probably never do in Malaysia). I can travel, meet new people, live on my own terms, and so much more. And I can come back to Malaysia with a solid chuck of change (~RM160k in 2 years). This sounds like a no brainer option to me. But what worries me the most is when I come back to Malaysia I will have very little relevant working experience and I'll be pushing close to 30. I don't know if anyone will hire someone that only has a couple of cybersecurity certificate but no working experience, especially in Malaysia.

I've been weighing my options for a while and I'm leaning on staying but I would love to hear some opinions from working professionals, both young and old.

ldz666,MalaysianPF,1612623527.0,"*Disclaimer: I am not a finance professional, I do not have fiduciary duty to you. This is not a financial advice, this is purely for educational and entertainment purposes. If you lose money trading cryptocurrencies, do not hold me accountable.*

Cryptocurrencies are like teenage sex, don't expect to talk people out of doing it. So instead of that, we should have a guide for safe and sane gambling plan for cryptocurrencies.

This guide is meant for beginners. You will see other experienced traders commenting in this section, take everyone's advice and comments with grains of salt.

Be very careful when someone is promoting their coin, pump and dump is rampant in cryptocurrencies realm. Play safe!

### What coins to invest in?

For beginners, to play safe - Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Understanding how cryptocurrencies work require knowledge of computer science and cryptography, and none of us can likely explain them well and accurate enough in the comments section, so I will just point you to: https://www.luno.com/learn/en/

I am not gonna explain what they do, but rather, why they are my top picks. 

Bitcoin's technology is proven.  It's the first proven solution of its kind - proof-of-work based value transfer. However, the development has practically stagnated for past few years with little progress.

Ethereum's development is more decentralised and backed by more organisations. There are at least 4 ETH1 clients and 4 ETH2 clients for you to choose from, all built by different teams and companies. It's the first blockchain of its kind - smart contract.

The real kicker of Ethereum is that - it powers almost all the tokens in DeFi realm. Almost all the tokens you see like Uniswap, USD Tether, USD Coin, OmiseGo, HelloGold etc run on Ethereum. Whenever people send those tokens, they must buy and spend ETH. ETH is indispensable from DeFi realm at this point.

Until now, there aren't many altcoins out there that share the same advantages to these two. It pays to invest in chains with first mover advantages.

BTW, don't buy into marketing like ""bitcoin killer"", ""ethereum killer"", ""more scalable than bitcoin"" etc. Do more homework if you want to venture beyond the 2 largest coins. Rather miss out sick gains than getting scammed.

### Where do we trade them in Malaysia?

To be safe, use the exchanges approved by Suruhanjaya Sekuriti. Luno is likely your best choice, they have good trading volume and low fees of 0.25% for makers, the fee applies to you if you only post order, not take them.

There are other exchanges you can use, just make sure you check their trading volume, history of being hacked etc: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges)

### When do we buy and sell them?

Now this... nobody knows for sure, but there are previous data points we can look at and play safe.

There are a few graphs I have bookmarked since the last crash and they have been fairly accurate so far:

1. [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/uYKn9Nrx-Bitcoin-longterm-chart/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/uYKn9Nrx-Bitcoin-longterm-chart/) - 2018
2. [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/NSwKGFGh-Updated-longterm-BTC-chart-The-road-to-1-million/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/NSwKGFGh-Updated-longterm-BTC-chart-The-road-to-1-million/) - 2019

For example, you can buy when its below 2x the previous all time high, and start selling slowly bit by bit above that point.

Don't be greedy and hold all the way until the peak, you can't tell where it take a u-turn and crash. Take profit and come back years later. Repeat.

### Should we withdraw them to our own wallets?

IMO, if you invest more than RM 10k, do it. Otherwise don't bother.

Sending Bitcoin and Ethers is not free, you need to pay network fees.

During peak hours, the transaction fees can easily surge beyond RM100-200 per transaction, regardless of amount transferred. Ethereum gas fees have reached 500 gwei recently, and I expect it to get a lot worse leading up to the peak.

Sure, leaving them on exchanges may be risky, but big exchanges are getting better at security, blacklisting addresses complicit in hacking.

If you don't hold a lot, maybe it's not worth withdrawing out to your paper wallet, phone wallet, hardware wallet etc.

### Why don't diversify into many coins? (Addendum)

Even now, cryptocurrencies are highly correlated assets. Almost all the coins moon and doom together, with some spikes here and there like when Elon Musk tweets Doge.

Cryptocurrencies are volatile and risky enough, try not to take on more unnecessary risks. There are little chance the altcoins you choose will outperform the blue chips. We call them shitcoins.

A day after FTX sent the wire transfer, I received a call from Officer S regarding the foreign TT and the conversation was something like this:

&nbsp;

*Officer S*: Hi Good Morning, I'm S from Harimau Bank. May I speak to Mr. soyasoya5 ?

*Me (running out of meeting room)*: Hi yes speaking.

*Officer S*: This is regarding a foreign TT deposit to your account.

*Me*: Yes, is it a deposit of USD XX from FTX Inc?

*Officer S*: Oh actually it's USD YY, difference may due to fees lah. But the sender is from a ""***North Dimension Inc***"" ...

*Me*: ...

*Officer S*: This transaction is currently on hold by our headquarters since its a huge amount. We will need some supporting document from you before we can process this transaction. May I know the purpose of this transfer?

*Me*: ...

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was at this moment I panicked a little. I've never transferred such a huge amount before, and despite cryptocurrency trading not being illegal, it somehow felt like I was caught doing something illegal, especially since I was never notified that the sender may not be **North Dimension Inc**. I was simultaneously thinking what kind of hot dumpster fire did I land myself on, and trying to recall the ""purpose"" I've decided on without mentioning the word ""cryptocurrency"" since there are stories of accounts getting closed due to mentioning the ""lucky"" keyword.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*Me*: Oh this is a liquidation and withdrawal of my foreign investment and capital assets.

*Officer S*: Oh okay...

*Officer S*: Are you working right now or ... ? Our records here show you're still a student.

*Me*: Ya I'm working.

*Officer S*: Okay then, we need to update your info and also can you provide the supporting documents and a copy of your IC?

*Me*: What kind of supporting documents do you require?

*Officer S*: Any contract or agreement that can be as a proof of transaction between you and the sender.

*Me*: Okay..

*Officer S*: Okay I will email you the forms at xxx @ xxx, is that right?

*Me*: Ya.

*Officer S*: Okay thank you very much, have a nice day.

*Call ends here*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Well... At this point I was thinking WTF, who? what? North Dimension Inc ? What contract or agreement can I possibly obtain from an entity I've literally never heard of until just now ? If you've traded on crypto exchanges before, you'd know there's no such letters or contracts of any kind. FTX didn't even provide a receipt or anything on their platform, it was just a one-line ""Withdraw Completed"" on the Withdrawals tab and nothing more. Just like that my ""nice day"" turned into a ""not so nice day"".

I returned back to work thinking what documents can there possibly be... Googling the sender gave me no results other than a hardwarezone SG post mentioning the same sender from FTX. At this point it was lunch time and my colleagues decided to eat some Yong Tau Foo. On the way to the restaurant I got this brilliant idea of contacting FTX support on telegram, and so I tried my luck there. Within seconds, multiple scammers & impersonators messaged me, ""Hi sir is your issue solved?"" ""Hi, becareful of fake admin, join this totally not fake link so we can understand & totally help you"" etc etc. Thank god blocking on telegram only requires 1 press, fuck scammers.

&nbsp;

While I was getting my Êñô (ingredients) which btw was **1 chilli, 2 tau fu pok, 1 fu zhuk, 2 fish balls, 1 tofu**, an admin responded in the chat and we took the conversation to DMs.

*Count food uncle*: Want any extra? ( Yong Tau Foo is usually eaten with rice/noodle etc )

At this point my eyes and hands were glued to my phone screen and I totally misinterpreted as the uncle asking if I wanted any extra ingredients, I replied ""No"".

My conversation with the admin was basically useless as he just repeated lines from the FAQ, and finally after me pushing for ""details exactly as sent from FTX"", he sent me an image which contains sender & beneficiary details which to no one's surprise, still useless. The receiving bank was listed as Silvergate and there was no mention of any North Dimension Inc nor my name or harimau bank.

*Order drink kakak*: Boy tak nak nasi ke?


I was busy fingering my phone screen cropping & screenshotting emails to the admin so he can provide less useless information, so I just replied ""Tak mau"".
Further conversation with the admin was even more useless as it can basically be summarized to ""dont give a fuck, you're shit outta luck"".

Then my food came and I realised, I fucked up.. Only ingredients & soup without rice or noodles. Thus my day went from ""not so nice"" to ""shit fuck"". And for the cherry on top of the shit cake, the admin ignored my question regarding payment receipts and ghosted me till this day.

&nbsp;

After lunch, I returned to office and created a support ticket in FTX requesting ""**payment receipt**"". Then I called Officer S to clarify that I do not have documents like contracts or agreements since its a trading platform. Officer S understood immediately and told me an account statement would suffice(FTX doesn't have account statements either), so we had to agree on providing deposit/withdrawal/trade history.

I immediately exported the requested data into CSV, filled in a Borang Pengakuan Penerimaan, and other relevant documentation and sent it to Officer S via email. By 6PM, Officer S replied with ""Received with thanks, fund expected to be credited by tomorrow"". I let out a sigh of relief. 

&nbsp;

But then, 30 minutes later, Officer S emailed me again.

***Can give PDF format or screenshot? Just like statement account***

... 

And so I did. Then I went to sleep.

&nbsp;

\------------------

The next morning I woke up, went to work, checked my bank account, and to my pleasant surprise the funds were credited along with my salary ! Hurray! Also FTX support ticket was updated and their banking team sent me an email containing a screenshot of the receipt which I no longer need. Now to print more paperwork to transfer 1 lump sump to my US broker, and hope my account doesnt get closed due to ""high risk"" transactions...

Thoughts and conclusions:

1. Look into opening SG bank account and transfer through there as advised by my colleague since there wont be questioning by BNM/local bank. (Will take some time to open & approve account)
2. Don't panic, and clarify facts lest you waste time and stress over simple matters which can be solved by simple clarification (types of supporting documents)
3. Telegram/Chatting App support is useless and is mostly for general issues, don't waste your time there unless you have to and go straight for more official channels (Open ticket using website support, email or phone)
4. Prepare for tax man if you chose this path
5. Thanks Officer S, for being the most helpful party in this whole ordeal

q6gio0,MalaysianPF,1634022786.0,"Hey there! I thought I would share my experience as an investor so far, just learning on the go. And I'm now at a bit of a cross-roads, so I would appreciate some advice. 

**Some background on myself:**

* I'm a professional in my early 30s. Malaysian. 
* Started working as a trainee when I was 22ish, on a salary of around RM2.5k / month. I kept working until my salary reached around RM8.5k / month when I was 28. 
* During this time, I didn't invest any money. I was focused on...um...being young, partying, having fun, trying to find a girlfriend, etc. *My mindset was different*. Still, I should have invested at least a little bit.
* Anyways, thankfully by my late 20's, I settled down and got married. And I moved overseas for a job which pays RM30k / month. The huge jump in salary is hard to describe in words. It's the smalls things I remember; the little changes in lifestyle. I won't bore you with the details though. 

**My investments:**

I've been overseas for a few years now. Bear in mind, I'm an investment noob. So what did I do?

* First, I put my funds into my ASB account. Until it reached RM200k.
* Once I reached 200k, I didn't know what to do. So I opened ASB2...and put in RM50k.
* Then I thought...*what's the point of ASB2*? It's similar to ASB, just that it seems to pay slightly less dividend. I should try something *different*.
* So I stopped putting money into ASB2, and bought some Manulife Unit Trust products instead. I invested in RM100k worth of Manulife Unit Trust, spread between funds in the US, China and Asia-Pacific (Korea, Taiwan mostly). To be honest, the sales charge is definitely on the high side. But I didn't know anything, and Manulife is a reputable company, and I was dealing with a physical human being (the agent). So I thought that its still worth it for the long-term.
* *Side note* \- years ago I was lured by Public Mutual to invest a portion of my EPF savings into their Unit Trusts (around RM30k). After they took my money, they never contacted me again. I did a manual check on their website on the Unit Trusts where they parked my money. I think it made like 5% growth after 7 years, which is terrible. I would have received better returns just keeping the money in EPF. Honestly, I don't know what Public Mutual is doing. It still pisses me off.
* Anyways...recently, I also took a loan to purchase a property in KL (for investment). The property costs around RM600k, so its nothing too crazy. It's still under construction, scheduled to be completed in 2024. Hopefully I can find a tenant to at least cover some of the loan.
* Then I looked at reddit a couple weeks ago, and came to know about Wahid Invest. ""Robo-advisor"", first time I came across this type of thing. I did some 'research' i.e. I watched some Youtube reviews. I just opened an account and deposited RM5K. Too early to tell what will happen. But I'm thinking of gradually putting in funds until I reach RM100k.
* Oh, one more thing. CIMB approached me and said I can become a ""Preferred Customer"". *If I do this, then one of their wealth managers would just take care of all my investments*. It sounds tempting to me because the wealth manager would have far more time and expertise than me to make investment decisions. I'm just a passive investor; I have my own full time job so I can't be looking at stock prices all day. **The only caveat is that I need to put RM150k in a CIMB savings account.** Technically its doable, but I would need some time, as I don't want to liquidate any of my existing investments to do this. 

**My risk tolerance:**

* I'm willing to take some risk. For years, my money just sat in a savings account doing nothing, which I still kick myself over. And I don't think FD rates are attractive. I like ASB because it is safe and at least generates some modest returns. But I can take on more risk... which is why I started investing in Manulife and Wahid.
* But I'm not a gambler. Like, I think crypto is too volatile for me. 
* I like the idea of diversifying as well. 
* I have around RM10-20k to invest each month.

\*\*

**So, what now? I'm at a crossroads.** If you were me, what would you do? Should I just continue putting funds into Wahid? Should I focus on becoming a CIMB preferred customer, so that I can let a wealth manager take care of my investments? Is there some other investment opportunity I don't know about?

I saw a lot of ppl who posted here have quite a bit higher pay, plenty of saving, or just having a highly sought after job. I know everyone has their own path and pace to achieving their financial goals. So I wish to know what are some realistic financial goal for me at my level.

I studied law, worked in the industry for \~ 2 years and decided to leave because the pay doesnt seem to scale well with the amount of workload/stress one has to endure, not to mention the toxic culture in general.

I spent quite some time jumping here and there (different industry, so my pay has been stagnant for years). Finally I found my current job, working as an advisor in a University. The pay is entry level, disposable income at 3k a month

My monthly expenses are as follows: -

1. 400 - **Rent + Utility**  \- I rent in campus hostel, I could save slightly more if I stay at home but its toxic in my house and I want my own privacy
2. 150 - **Transport**  \- down from 500 since I stay nearby my office now.
3. 300 **Internet/Phone Bills** \- I pay for my parents bills as well.
4. 600 **Food** \- now that I stay outside this has increased.
5. 250 **PTPTN** \- I paid off like 10k, still has 30k to go.
6. 300 - **Entertainment** like going for movies/drinks

So basically every month I am left with roughly 1000 of saving, currently I have 10k in my saving account (following the 3-6 months emergency fund practice), 7k in PMO, and 2k in Stashaway. I know these investments are for long term, and should not be touched for at least 5-10years

My last pay increase in this job was a measly 4%, I do enjoy my current job, the colleagues are chill, boss is good, environment is not toxic, in fact I do want to take up more responsibility but I have no idea how much do I get pay, or what is the career progression in the Education industry (have no intention to teach, just work in office/management)

I have friends who told me to become a unit trust consultant (but as an introvert I am not good at sales - I hated a telemarketing job I had in UOB years ago)

Another friend also told me that investment is cool and all, but I need to find more income, to become an entrepreneur and escape the ""rat race"". I understand that but I also think being an entrepreneur is also very high risk, the risk of failure and having all go down the drain. My friend told me he is doing some distributor work for one-time use disposable utensils for events/hotel.

As I approach 30, I have barely any saving, a 30k loan and not much of a financial goal. Tying myself to buying any property is a bad idea given how little my income is, and no amount of ""investment""/saving will help much and it seems the only way out is to earn more money.

But my question is, how do I earn more?

tv2lao,MalaysianPF,1648966397.0,"Hi all. Throwaway account. Seeking for advice.

So, here's the context:

1. Me and family (grandma, mom, and I, plus 2 cats) are still renting at a Selangor suburb double-storey terrace, RM900 a month, for almost about 5 years now. (we also have been renting all our lives, but at other places. This house has been the longest since.)
2. So we have been planning to buy a house for our own stay.
3. Mom is a single mother since we were kids, and has been a bankrupt ever since, so cannot buy house. She is still working, self-employed, making abt RM1k - RM2k a month. Siblings have moved out (renting also) close to their work.
4. So I have just started working at a private company, for almost a year now. So I carry the responsibility to buy the house. And I want to. Really wanna live in a house that we can call our own. (siblings willingly agreed to also chip in the monthly repayment though)

&#x200B;

My profile:

1. 26 y/o f single, fresh grad
2. Net pay is RM3000, office in Klang Valley
3. Commitment: credit card (5% of credit limit is RM175). No other commitment.
4. Budget: <RM320k. But mom has always wanted a landed house in Selangor. But about that... ok more on that later.

&#x200B;

So, we went house hunting for months, did our ""research"", went to rumah contoh and all that. Long story short we placed a booking for a townhouse project KITA Mekar at Cybersouth. Agent submit loan.

\- Selling price: RM419,900.00 (I know! So out of budget. But its like the cheapest for a landed house in good area of Selangor and the agent said there's a possibility of my loan being approved.)

\- Nett price after discount: RM369,910.00

\- Zero d/p, free legal fee, loan fee, MOT. Booking: RM500.00

\- Free kitchen cabinet

\- Malay reserved land; 1,346 SF, 4BR + 2B + store + yard (townhouse lower unit)

\- Year of completion: Q2 2024

\- Distance to/from work: 36 km, 45 mins (MEX) Toll: Up to RM11 per day.

\- By then the MRT Cyberjaya will be in operation so can take MRT.

&#x200B;

So after a while, we thought, ok let's also opt for high rise since its more ngam with our budget. I applied RUMAWIP (mom didn't really quite like since its in KL. I like, because its closer to work. But after thinking about my mom and grandma, the house is not as comfortable for them to live long term). And then we found a project that make us reconsider our life choices. Residensi Adelia 3, Bangi Avenue.

\- Selling price: RM338,000.00

\- Nett price: RM304,200.00

\- D/P: 10%, Rebate: 9%. So deposit only become 1% which is booking: RM1000.00, upon sign SPA: RM2,380.00

\- Free furniture (3 aircond, 3 wardrobe, 3 water heater, kitchen cabinet and tabletop, fridge, TV 32 inch, cabinet TV)

\- Freehold; 1045 SF, 3BR (2 master bedroom) + 3B + yard + balcony

\- Year of completion: Q4 2024/Q1 2025

\- Distance to/from work: 37 km, 45 mins (PLUS) Toll: Up to RM3 per day. But jammed as hell I think.

\- But can drive to MRT Kajang and take MRT.

&#x200B;

We already placed a booking for this project also. Fully refundable. I know, we made impulsive decisions :(. Agent said after some weeks we can choose unit, and then agent will submit loan. We like this project because it has 2 master bedrooms, which is perfect for all 3 of us. And the location. The town is more matured there. But for our cats... kinda sad la because our cats have been living the fabulous ""landed"" life for all their lives also (they love playing outside).

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now, the loan for the townhouse is approved under condition:

&#x200B;

\- Loan 100%

\- MLTA RMxxxx

\- MRTA RMxxxxx (30+0yrs)

\- Total loan RMxxxxxx

\- Rate 3%

\- Tenure 35 years

\- Repayment RM1,688

\- FD pledge RM 20k, for 5 years (btw what does this mean? Tried googling and reading but not quite get it)

\- Because loan is 100%, we will get 10% cash (around RM50k) on key collection.

&#x200B;

Our concerns are:

\- The repayment is too high. Although my siblings agreed to chip in, but there's really no guarantee we can rely on that. And not even including utilities, wifi etc yet. And my DSR also will be high too.

\- Scared if we don't sign this loan offer, and then what if loan for project Adelia also not approved.

\- After some calculation, let's say the loan for Adelia is approved under SAME condition as above, the monthly repayment can be up to RM1341, so quite a difference there. But that is if its under the same condition. The lowest repayment, (90% loan) is RM1170. Oh and the maintenance fee is also quite high, RM200.

&#x200B;

Other thoughts:

\- Townhouse in Selangor for that price is actually really worth it. ""2 years later, for RM369k can only get studio, nak dapat townhouse tak mungkin lagi. 2 years later when you see the property price, you might regret. The best time to buy a property is 10 years ago, the 2nd best time to buy is now"". These are the words from the agent. Deep down I kinda agree, it's a great asset but at what cost? Ikat perut to pay monthly :( Although the repayment starts upon key collection, which means in 2 years time, and probably my salary also increase (but who can guarantee, I also just started working). Yea, all is risk. High risk high return gitu. But, I really don't know to decide now.

&#x200B;

So my dear Malaysians, I would like to seek for your advice, thoughts, and anything that you can share with me. I really appreciate it.

I've written a Financial Independence and Retire Early (FI/RE) guide for Malaysians.

The gist of it is - Saving, Investing, and eventually Protecting your money.

Calculated my FI/RE amount to be RM1.08 million using the 30X annual expenses method. Was wondering if Redditors here have a different way of calculating your retirement amount and what are they?

Lately, there had been many cases of scammer in Malaysia conducted by Malaysians. There was even a post of r/malaysia bout a girl being scammed.

Now, to avoid being being scammed most of the time you only need **COMMON SENSE.** Malaysians scammer are not that advanced like some Indians or Nigerians scammer.

The only problem is the **NAIVETY** of most Malaysians. The standard operating procedure of scammer is that generally they would claim be a representative of authorities such as PDRM, Immigration or financial services such as you local Maybank, CIMB or the **most common nowadays BIGPAY**. They would either call you or voice call via WhatsApp.

What they would do is tht they would claim to be from BigPay and said that they recently sent a new card or smth like that and they need TAC from you.

Now at this point, if you dont realise that they are scammers, you better jump off  a building, at the very least you will be wiped out.

***DO NOT!! I REPEAT, DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR TAC!!*** TAC stands for  ***Transaction Authorisation Code***. IT is a ***ONE TIME PASSWORD*** added as an additional security fr your banking services.  Those 6 digits that you received via SMS? Those are TAC. If you ever received TAC without requesting one, it is time to change you banking password.

Now, once you come in contact with scammer how do you check whether they are scammer or not? It is simple, PDRM set up an online platform where you can check for scammer Account Number, Telephone Number and IC number called [Semak Mule](https://semakmule.rmp.gov.my/). There is also a google play store version. if there is a police report being made against those details, you better be careful. even if there is no police report being made against them does not it is safe, it means that no police report has been made against tht person.

The platform is good but there is a weakness in it since the data relies on police report being made and I assures you that there are plenty of victims out there that do not made a report even after being scammed.

Please Please Please I beg of you guys be more VIGILANT when it comes to scam. Double check the number. Also install **TrueCaller App** as they do in fact collects data bout number being used by scammers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/ql131m/how_to_avoid_being_scammed/,How to Avoid Being Scammed,Guide,51,14,0.83

I do have a passion for electronics and anything related to engineering but due to me dropping out and not having a cert to prove my competence practical work is probably the best I could do.

I've worked multiple jobs before this but the most recent one went out of business so I had to resign so I'm pretty much jobless atm.

-Familiar with autocad and 3d printing software

So far, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to do 2 voluntary internships from my past semester breaks..one from Big 4 and one from a well known insurance company.

What is the likelihood of me being a Malaysian Malay (as Singapore is a predominant Chinese country), on landing a job there, realistically? I can speak fluent mandarin as I was from a Chinese school back in my school years.

As mentioned, I have a few internship experiences so far and I heard Singaporean companies usually hire experienced Malaysian workers (1-2 years experience at least). What is the possibility of me getting a job in Singapore with those experiences I‚Äôve mentioned?

&#x200B;

My sister has just begun the third year of her five-year Dentistry programme at IMU. The total tuition fees for five years are RM600k, excluding rental and living expenses.

&#x200B;

Her goal has always been to study in New Zealand, and she has been accepted into the University's twinning programme and has completed all of the requirements.

&#x200B;

If she were to twin in New Zealand, her total university fees (including her studies in Malaysia) would be RM1.1 mil (as compared to 600k).

&#x200B;

She completed her foundation year in Melbourne, but our father, the family breadwinner, passed away in 2019, forcing us to return to Malaysia.

&#x200B;

I studied in Melbourne and finished my degree after my father died, and I am now working as a Graduate Accountant in KL. Salary is RM4.3k before taxes.

&#x200B;

My mother is currently battling stage 4 cancer and is on Alectinib, which costs us approximately RM100k per year. Mum does not have medical insurance. 

&#x200B;

The main topic of this thread is whether my family can afford to send my sister to New Zealand for the twinning programme.

&#x200B;

I believe the benefits of twinning outweigh the sacrifices made because she has a high chance of working in New Zealand after graduation due to her personal characteristics.

&#x200B;

I was also thinking that we could borrow RM300k from relatives (paying interest if necessary) to help with the affordability issue.

&#x200B;

The following are a summary of my family's estate (my mother, sister, and I):

\*Mum

Passive income = 7.5k per month

Cash + EPF + ASNB = 520k 

Equity on PPOR = 1.2mil

&#x200B;

\*Myself

Income = As above

Passive income = 1.8k per month

Cash + Investments (ETF, ASNB, SSPN, FD) = 1mil

Equity on investment property = 810k

\*Sister

Passive income = 3.7k per month

Equity on investment property = 375k

I have been earning quite a lot from YT since early 2021. It really blew up.

My problem is with tax. As soon as i started earning, Youtube implemented a law that all income from views from the US will be taxed at 30%.

90% of my income came from the US. Even before i receive my payment, they have already deducted it. They called it witholding.

So I received my payment after tax. Do I still need to be tax by lhdn?

Is double taxation a thing? 

Fyi my earnings from youtube is 6 figures upwards. So it is a lot of money and a lot of tax. I just dont want to be taxed twice.

qaekc1,MalaysianPF,1634528415.0,"A little on my background: I‚Äôm from the financial industry (one of the top 10 largest funds globally). Years in stock market: 8. Financial Literacy: 9/10.

There‚Äôs much being discussed on ETFs and robo-advisory here. I‚Äôd like to share something more niche and unconventional ‚Äì which is ramping up capital aggressively for investments and channeling the profits towards investments for the medium/long term and the following are based on my experiences.

Basically to sum it up, the **1st goal**: Aggressive growth of capital. **2nd goal**: buying into stocks for mid/long term investment horizon.

**2020:**

**Riding on the trend**

Made a comfortable profit by using ‚Äúfree money‚Äù ‚Äì Riding on the glove stocks trend, I bought on T+2 trades for glove stocks (Top Glove and Supermax). Made profits without forking out much capital and sold mostly within T+2 trades. Did this for a couple of months and it was profitable 80% of the time. You‚Äôll need a Plan B, such as have enough capital to take up the shares just in case. They were short term trades and I managed to exit as soon as vaccines rolled out.

**Zero Diversification**

For this strategy, the conviction has to be as accurate as possible. The returns of diversifying into 5 stocks yields lesser returns, which of course risk and rewards are at stake. From all the profits from the two glove stocks and additional capital, went all in for MR DIY in Nov/Dec 2020 at RM2.87. Sold all of it at RM4.10.

**2021:**

**Aggressive Growth of Capital**

https://preview.redd.it/tmq2piqsn4u71.jpg?width=919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cfda3b81049aac37a806ccee58989c0148b01393

The US stock market has always been on my radar since early 2020. Taking ETFs, robo-advisory and dividend stocks such as REITs into consideration, the past 5-years and 10-years performance does not fit my criteria of aggressive capital growth.

Entering into riskier trades is the fastest way to ramp up capital and double up. Aware of the risks involved, I only deployed money that I am ready to lose. Started some trades in commodities in May as the hot topic globally was inflation. The best hedge to ride on inflation is commodities such as gold. As the trades were at 20X leverage, made it a point to not hold it for more than 24 hours (also to avoid the min. fees for leverage).

From my relatively short experience in trading commodities (started in mid-May and stopped in June), it‚Äôs imperative to have discipline on:

1. Stop loss (the margin of error has to be minimal as positions were 20X leverage).
2. Not holding for not more than 24 hours.
3. Be very sensitive to economic data and news. From June onwards, the tides have turned as the Fed claims inflation is ‚Äútransitionary‚Äù. IMHO, inflation is not transitory. But the market thinks otherwise and the tides have turned to other asset classes.
4. Logic over emotions. It was relatively stressful trading commodities and was the stress worth it? Kind of. But I don‚Äôt think I would want to repeat it again as I appreciate a good night‚Äôs sleep.

Below are the trades made (as this is not a recommendation to buy or sell, I have blacked out those some names as I am still holding now):

From the profits and monthly DCA, I channeled them to medium and long term investments into only **6 stocks** and currently sitting on unrealized profits (gain porn):

However, it‚Äôs not all roses as I am also sitting on some unrealized losses for 2 stocks (loss porn):

Don‚Äôt plan to cut loss for now as I see potential in them to grow 2-5X in the next 2-3 years.

The reason I‚Äôm sharing my experience is that I‚Äôm pretty sure some of you might have once contemplated on this this strategy of ramping up capital aggressively and channeling the profits to medium and long term investments. It‚Äôs been tried, tested and worked.

Key considerations to take into account:

1. Sound understanding of the market, economic data, the Fed, politics, the flow of money/switch of asset classes according to expectations of the market.
2. Accuracy of trades and calls.
3. Use only money that you are ready to lose.
4. Due diligence on the stocks you‚Äôre buying for medium to long term investments (and review periodically if you need to change your positions).
5. To gage whether are you doing the right thing - always use S&P index as the benchmark. If you are outperforming the benchmark, it indicates you are doing the right thing. If not, you're better off buying index funds.

When you‚Äôre buying stocks ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have to buy a lot of stocks in your portfolio. Over diversification is never a good thing. Focus on the few with the best growth potential.

wy297y,MalaysianPF,1661497532.0,"Hi everyone!

I am a young person, have few years of work experience, single and living on my own in KL.

My income has been about a 10% raise from an average fresh grad salary per year over the last 5 years. It's ok but really not great for someone living on their own in KL (as opposed to living with parents).

I know there are many people who suggest living with parents to save money but let's just say that's not really an option for me right now.

My parents will also not leave me any inheritance or property. They have given me many good things which I appreciate but an inheritance or property is not one of them.

Though that would have been nice and helpful, I am very proud to say I took my savings from 3 digits (I worked part time in university but used the money to pay my college fees as PTPTN didn't cover the whole thing and my dad got sick) when I first started working, to hopefully reaching 6 digits in savings in the next 2-3 years (which would be 10 years of working full time). Yes, not a super impressive thing as I'm sure there are people earning 10x more than me, but something I am personally damn proud of.

Sorry, I got a little off topic but coming back to my post, seems that we need to prepare for a recession. On top of that, salary Vs cost of housing today as compared to 20-40 years ago is very different. For example, in the last 20 years, salaries have gone up 25% while housing has gone up 180%.

I do my best to be involved in pushing for better governance, less corruption etc by being involved in social justice and voting. But the reality is, all that is not going to change my reality of income Vs expenses.

What is going to change things is for me to spend less and earn more.

The common advice for young people in this regard is:

- Improve personal financial literacy. Read, watch, ask, learn. Have a budget, track expenses, etc.

- Reduce unnecessary spendings

- find alternatives (buy second hand, discount, etc)

- invest (EPF, ASNB, ETF, robo advisor etc)

- have a secondary or tertiary income (part time work, small business, etc)


Now, I'd like to ask MPF for some less common advice that is still really helpful.

For example, I recently have been looking into the possibility of remote work. It is not easy to find, not easy to get. But with my skillset and experience (copy writing), getting a part time job from a country like US seems like a possibility and would be very helpful with the exchange rate. This is something I've only recently learnt and am looking into.

Another suggestion I've recently tried is visiting the MalaysianPayGap IG page. Yes, it can be tough and sometimes a bit discouraging to see posts of people younger earning 3-5 times. But I realized that while those posts tend to go viral, the real gems are what the admin collates and compiles. Things like suggestions for part time work, things like career advancement strategies. They even have a dashboard to compare salaries based on industry. I think this is less known but very very helpful to make career and income moves.

What else advice can you share that is not so common, about:

- Saving

- investing

- earning

- buying/renting property

**Assumptions:**

* The calculation only takes into account the cost of going to work, and does not include other things like increased food expenses.
* There are 22 working days a month.
* Each working day is 8 hours
* Full Office means going back to office 5 days a week
* Hybrid means going back to office 2 days a week, and 3 days WFH
* Driving and Public Transport between Home and Office is around 3 hours per day (e.g. Klang to Kuala Lumpur)
* For Car Ownership, I assumed its a brand new 2018 MyVi (Installments + Insurance Maintenance + Fuel + Parking + Toll).
* Hourly Worth = Salary / Total hours worked per month e.g. 4000 / (22 days \* 8 hours)  = 22.7
* Cost of time loss due to commuting = hours spent commuting per month \* hourly worth
* Grab Expenses is around RM30/day. (This is not very accurate as a 3 hour commute would've easily cost more than that)

**Notes:**  
Recently I've noticed many companies nowadays are transitioning back to a full 5 day office arrangement. Fortunately, I'm lucky enough to still have a fully remote arrangement which allows me to maximize my savings in of money, time and energy.

The reason that prompted me to perform this analysis was the idea of jumping to another company for a higher pay raise, but at the expense of moving back to a full office arrangement. What is the point of gaining a higher salary if it meant I kept the same amount of savings at the end of the month, plus I now lose tons of free time and energy for personal life? 

My hypothesis is staying at a fully remote company for RM4000 salary, is a much better deal than working for a fully office company for a RM5500 salary, as the difference of RM1500 does not justify the added transportation cost + time loss. It's like if my boss asked me to work extra 66 hours per month for a extra RM1500 a month, I would've definitely said no.

The best case scenario would be to maintain a full WFH arrangement whilst increasing your salary. The 2nd best option is to opt for a Hybrid + My50 Pass arrangement, which is still within a reasonable range.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/s8ohwl/napkin_analysis_the_cost_of_moving_from_a_full/,Napkin analysis: the cost of moving from a Full WFH to a Full 5 day office arrangement,Career,46,23,0.94

Invest in low-cost total market index fund/ETF. Start early, & consistent over a LONG PERIOD. & do dollar-cost-averaging. That's it. It's basically Warren Buffet's advice too. Doing this can safely make u a millionaire by the age of retirement.

Screw active mutual funds. those things eat up too much of your money through management fees, & even more if you invest through an agent who takes a commission.

Also I've decided to forget about investing in individual stocks. I don't wanna waste my precious time & life worrying about every single news that effects my stocks, & having to actively trade on a regular basis. 

However, local ETFs performance are terrible, just look at our S&P500 equivalent, which is FBM KLCI 30. So I've figured decided on the US market instead. History has shown that the market always bounces back up, even after recessions like the dotcom bubble, 2008 crash, & the recent 2020 pandemic.

I am a local undergrad student(non-bumi) and going to grad soon in August. May I get your advice on:  


1) How to manage my finance when I start working? How much to save after getting the paycheck?   
2) On investment. What are the investments that I should learn so I can build wealth starting at the age of 23.  
3) What are the mistakes that young people often make in financing?   
4) If you could go back to your 20s, what would you do better in financing?

  


These are my questions for now. My ultimate goal is to start to building wealth at the age of 23 and I realize that the sooner I know about investment and financing, the better I am in the future. I might not come out as a Millionaire but I could enjoy the financial freedom that comes with this decision that I have made.

10ytq1l,MalaysianPF,1676040282.0,"Hi redditors. I‚Äôm in need of a third party opinion on my conundrum. 

Me(F33) is working for an automotive company (company A) My take home salary currently is RM5000. I love my job. I‚Äôm good at what I do. I am very grateful that I‚Äôve found a job that I‚Äôm excited to go to work for. I‚Äôm also on track to be a ‚Äúfuture leader‚Äù of company A. 

Now this is just not my POV, I have touch based with the top management of the said company, this is their word not mine.  I have a good repo with the top management, this itself is not common and I have work hard to show them I‚Äôm worthy of their attention. 

However, I‚Äôve been scouted by another automotive company (company B) for same level designation but with a 40% take home salary increment. 

Company B, is a legacy company. They are not as robust or outside thinkers as company A. But thy want to hire ppl like me to ‚Äúchange the company‚Äôs mindset‚Äù. 

Now, I know my salary from company A is not a lot but I‚Äôm in a position whereby money is secondary to me. This is not saying I‚Äôm rich or anything. It‚Äôs just even with my measly salary, I have manage to have RM30k cash in saving so far and another RM10k in bonds. My commitments monthly is around 2k a month. 

For me, this is enough. I don‚Äôt want to be trap in this mindset of more money the better cause, if my goal is getting more money, it will not end.  

When company A saw this offer, they counter offer me at lower percentage increment in salary but with a bigger bonus. So I rejected company B offer, but now they have come back to me and offer me more money. When I asked how much, they say they can go as far as 60% of my take home salary now. 

This increment means I have to do more work, to set a new pace. The management of this company is keen to get in onboard.  The HR is following up with me daily, and I‚Äôve still have not made up my mind. 

It flatters me that company B has this much faith in me. And I feel bad about rejecting them the 2nd time. But I still think I can be at a higher position in 2 years with company A than B.

So if you are in position do you choose company A or B ? I‚Äôm too involved in this and I can‚Äôt seem to make up mind. 

Thanks !


Edit : thanks for all of your opinions, I have read and weight my options. I officially rejected Company B the 2nd time. Like many of you said, legacy company is a red flag. While making more money sound enticing, my gut is telling me stay. 

The funny thing is the HR person still asked me to reconsider and won‚Äôt accept my decision cause it‚Äôs not a working day. 
According to them it‚Äôs not valid üòÇ.. ill tell them No again during a working day I guess..

A bit of background about me 
I was sponsored to study overseas before and my allowance was around ~RM4.5k and my spending habits was a bit on a high side. When I graduated, I got a job that pays me RM3k which is much lesser than my then allowance. Then somebody suggested a credit card just for good records in CTOS (in case i want to buy a car/house later). But it turned haywire from that day. I keep on spending the money I didn‚Äôt have. 2 years later, I am down with 2 credit cards which is on max limit (but I never fail to pay the minimum amount monthly). I also have a personal loan of 19k (monthly of around RM220) to fund my part time studies before. It was a mistake as back then I only need RM7k as loan and was being pressured by the SA to take RM20k loan because it was during a ‚Äúpromo‚Äù. I settled my credit cards at that time but it has reach max limit again now because of my bad spending habits.

I started to regret and since few months ago I start to be frugal and start to pay everything on cash, bring homecooked food to work and stop shopping (only shop on bundle clothes). I feel like I have better spending habits now (learned it the hard way lol). I plan to pay off the credit cards and maintain just one credit card for emergency. I am currently getting around RM4k ish and looking forward for promotion and bonus next year. I don‚Äôt have demanding commitments other than paying for rent, insurance, give money for my mom and my cat foods which is around RM1.5k per month.

Details of the credit cards:
Hsbc- i opted for 6-months installment with lower interest rate which will be settled in Jan 2023.
Maybank- currently paying minimum amount until I finish the other bank‚Äôs CC.

Even if you have an account with TDA, IBKR, Tiger, is buying US index fund the best thing you can do now? Here are the signs of US stock market bubbles and irrational exuberance that we can see now:

- Tesla being unprofitable is larger than nearly all automakers combined
- Actively managed ETF like ARK suddenly becoming popular - Cathie isn't the problem, the fund inflow from retail traders is the problem
- SPACs aka blank check companies
- GameStop, AMC, Blackberry, tech stocks goreng2

OK fine, things are happening, it feels like a bubble in US, but how do we quantify it? 

Enter [Shiller PE](https://www.lynalden.com/shiller-pe-cape-ratio/) - a way to measure if a whole stock market in some countries is overvalued or not. Go read the article.

At the end, she mentioned Malaysia and Singapore stocks are some of the unusually cheap (low CAPE ratio) compared to US. In her other articles, she also said VXUS is not very ideal because Japan and EU stocks are not exactly cheap either.

Her blog is full of great stuff, if you are a new investor or generally interested in macro econs, please read her blog, you will learn A LOT.

It's kinda scary to buy Malaysian stocks when we see the KLCI has been dropping for 5-10 years, but CAPE ratio measures 10 years time frame, maybe it's time to YOLO and stock up on KLSE counters?

### Update

Actionable steps if you believe in this:

1. If you have StashAway, turn your risk level to 36% for the least exposure to US, and get emerging market ETFs.
2. If you can trade on SGX, buy Nikko AM's or SPDR's STI ETF.
3. If you can trade on NYSE, choose the ETFs mentioned by Lyn, or pick EWM, EWS, etc

You can search online for tutorials on how to transfer your crypto from Binance to another exchange/wallet without having to sell it all for cash. This way you can continue enjoying the price gains (if you are willing to take the risk, which has always been present)

While Luno exchange is great for beginners, there are actually better options out there for trading (but they're not officially licensed by our SC) such as the popular exchanges : Kucoin, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.

However, crypto exchanges hold possession of your private key of your wallet, so while you can actually transfer crypto out, you don't have full control over them, so the exchanges can freeze ur control if they choose to.

Hence, real crypto wallets such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, Electrum are better options for storage, as you have control of your private key at all times, and full control. You should hold the majority of your crypto in wallets rather than exchanges, unless you plan to regularly trade a large % of your crypto portfolio.

Finally the most secure but most (initially) expensive option is a hardware wallet, where the private keys are physically stored in a small device. They are less prone to hacks. 

In the end, please DYOR (Do Your Own Research), on the different options, their advantages and disadvantages. Most importantly, if you can, please learn about the technology behind cryptocurrencies, specifically on how they are sent and on what networks, as this is very relevant to all of us on preventing yourself from sending crypto incorrectly and subsequently losing it forever.

I decided to tender my resignation in my full time job to pursue my business as a full time but my company decided to show some ways to me and offered a flexi lifestyle where my working hours is cut down to 50% as well as my salary and I'm given a guarantee of a **promotion** and I can leverage on that incase my business ever failed. I worked in this company for almost 2 years but I believed they offered me this is because I'm the key person in the project and if I were to leave, the project may get delay.

I don't know if it has already been done here before, but I've always wanted a place where people can share and discuss their experience in using their CC. I know there's plenty of reviews out there, but as we all know, every CC has their own limitations and and caveats that's not well advertised, and most of these online reviewers only get their information from the front page of RinggitPlus without even bothering to see the \* disclaimer, let alone T&C. So I thought I could kick things off, and hopefully this become a thing in the future and make things easier for people to select their go-to cards.

&#x200B;

**The Basics.**

Min Salary Req: RM2,000

Annual Fee: RM100, Free for 3 years. Waived when you spend min RM15,000 annually subsequent years.

&#x200B;

**The Perks.**

(1)**Lazada Purchase:**  10pt every RM1. capped at RM500 monthly.

&#x200B;

(2)**Telco & Insurance:**  5pt every RM1, capped at RM500 monthly.

&#x200B;

**(3)Selected online subscription, food delivery including Apple, Foodpanda, Grabfood, Steam, PS, Netflix:** 5pt every RM1, capped at RM500 monthly.

&#x200B;

**(4)Other Retalis & Petrol:** 1pt every RM1.

&#x200B;

**(5)Monthly Bonus Point:** 1000pt when you spend RM1,500.

&#x200B;

(6)**Various (limited) Lazada Voucher**

&#x200B;

**Actual experience.**

I've been using this card for almost a year, and not once have I gotten the various Voucher as it always ran out.

&#x200B;

I've always maxed out the 2 out of the 3 capped categories, that's the Lazada Purchase and Telco & Insurance. I rarely use food delivery, but I do have a Netflix sub and I do buy some game from Steam from time to time. I do spend more than RM1500 on the card every month.

&#x200B;

Every month, I would earn roughly 10,000-15,000pt, constantly 5000 from (1), 2500 from (2), 1000 from (5), the rest are from the occasional (3) and (4). The point can only be used to offset your Lazada purchase, which is great because you're not stuck within the bank's overpriced catalogue, and the list is vast. It can also be used to pay off your Lazada Wallet Topup, which is usually a round number and this make it easier to gauge the value of the points, so that we can understand the real-world value instead of the point.

&#x200B;

For every 80,000pt, I can pay off RM100 of Lazada purchase, which goes down to RM0.00125/pt, or 0.125% ""Cashback""

&#x200B;

If I spend RM500 on a \[*certain category*\] I would get a \[*""cashback""*\] *of*:-

\[Non-Bonus\] - \[Cashback RM0.625 (0.125%)\]

\[Telco/Ins\] - \[Cashback RM3.125 (0.625%)\]

\[Online Sub/Food Delivery\] - \[Cashback RM3.125 (0.625%)\]

\[Lazada\] - \[Cashback RM6.25 (1.25%)\]

&#x200B;

Assuming I spend RM1500 a month, maximizing all of the bonus category, I would net RM6.25 (Lazada) + RM3.125 (Telco/Ins) + RM3.125 (Sub/Del) + RM1.25 (Bonus 5) = RM13.75/month, or RM165/year. That's 0.91% of the value spent.

&#x200B;

Compare that to Citibank's very own Cashback card, they offer a 10% cashback on Petrol, Dining, Groceries and Grab, capped at RM10 per category, plus 0.2% on all other retail spending and you would only have to spend RM500 every month, with an annual fee of RM120.

&#x200B;

Assuming I spend RM500 a month, maximizing all of the bonus category, I would net roughly RM40/month, or RM480/year. Even when the Citibank's 3 years free annual fee expires, I would still net RM360 every year, while not much, but still free money and doubles the net of the Lazada Citi Platinum.

&#x200B;

If I have both cards, (I do), and if I spend more than RM500 (RM700 for example) each on online shopping & Insurance (I do), the first RM500 would surely goes Lazada Citi Platinum as it would net me RM9.375(1.25%+0.625%) as opposed to RM2.00(0.2%) on Cibank Cashback. The next 400 (200+200) would go to Citibank Cashback as it would net me RM0.80(0.2%) as opposed to RM0.50(0.125%)

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

**Pros**

\-Not restricted to bank's catalogue for point redemption, wide selection on Lazada

\-OKayish bonus reward point value

\-Vouchers

\-Low entry requirement

\-3 years free annual fee

&#x200B;

**Cons**

\-Low bonus spending caps (500)

\-Low reward point value

\-High spending requirement to waive annual fee

\-Lazada interface

&#x200B;

All and all, it's still a good starter card, especially if you love shopping in Lazada and don't mind spending the time to grab the vouchers. Even better if you're already spending 500 a month on each of the category.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/11mutw1/cc_user_review_citibanks_lazada_citi_platinum/,CC User Review: Citibank's Lazada Citi Platinum,Credit cards,42,9,0.98

y3wmh8,MalaysianPF,1665760461.0,"Hello. I'm a mid 20s (bumi) starting on my first job and am looking for advice to understand and manage personal finance better.

Salary after EPF etc.: RM2.8k

I allocate according to 50/30/20 rule: 50% (RM1400) goes to my needs, 30% (RM840) to personal indulgences and 20% (RM560) into savings. I live with my parents and am using their car (Myvi) for daily commute to work. A breakdown of my 50% expenditures, monthly:

1. Allocation to family - RM350 (2 persons)
2. Bills - RM600 (TNB, TIME, Phone and IWK; I pay the full amount)
3. Education loan - RM150
4. Medical takaful - RM250 set aside for next annual contribution (Family package, signed up with my parents)

I have been taking out RM450 (RM200 cash, RM200 e-Wallet, RM50 for fuel) from my 30% allocation for groceries and food, which rightfully should come from the 50%. The rest is set aside for car insurance and road tax, which should be around RM1k next July. Currently, I find this practice is acceptable but not comfortable as I want to own a car and house in the future. And I do not have emergency fund set up yet.

**How can I organize this better?** I don't see any particles that I can drop off.

Besides this, I'm using my Maybank Savings account for all the transactions mentioned. The 20% saved stays there too. I understand that using one bank for everything is risky. I have 3 other bank accounts - BSN, Bank Islam and Bank Muamalat (plan to close Bank Muamalat, and let BSN dormant). 

I'm thinking of diversifying my bank accounts. I'd want to ideally have a bank account that rewards for less frequent but large amount transaction dedicated for personal indulgence eg. travel, tech and hobbies expenditures. A work colleague advised opening an overseas bank account like Standard Chartered as it may be safer considering there's cases large sum of money lost to scam with local banks. 

**May I know what other options are available, preferably hassle-free ones when opening? Or the ones I have/plan is good already?**

Onto my savings, I plan to distribute the 20% into Tabung Haji, ASB and set an emergency fund. Tried to open ASB account through the app, it presented me with 3 options ASN Sara, ASN Imbang and ASN Ekuiti.

**Can someone explain the differences between the three? ASB FAQs aren't helping.**

**Is using Tabung Haji as emergency fund as advisable? I have achieved the minimum goal for Hajj registration.**

I've subscribed to this subreddit for a while now but sadly the community isn't very engaging , I am guessing it's probably because many questions asked were either left unanswered or given a vague reply , and I am here to help solve that.

A quick glance at this sub , most question are related to investment in general , which I can humbly say is my forte. A lil bit of background bout myself , I am currently 27 , been trading the FX and CFD markets for close to 6 years now , and the equity ( Bursa ) market for about 4 years. I have a bachelor degree in finance and investment , and have read probably all the personal finance / investment books out there in the market , along with experimenting with different investment strategies with my own money. While I am not too sure what I would like to commit my life to for the next ten years aside from continue trading the markets , I feel like debunking personal finance myth , and provide the community with the right attitude or direction towards growing long term wealth is something that I might want to do long term.

So please fire away , if you have any money related questions. But please bear in mind , ultimately all my answers are my own subjective opinion , and personal finance remain a very personal issue , there is simply no one size fits all solution. That said , I would try to rationalize my answer as to why it's the best decision for me , and probably you too.

Is it worth it for me to buy a residential land now when its 'cheap'? Or should I continue invest in other investment vehicles that can compound? Currently, I have my sights on a few but will only get one.

Financially, the mortgage would take away 5-10% of my current monthly income. Naturally, this would get smaller as my income grows over time. As for commitments, I have no car currently, been WFH. Just one credit card. My expenses are also budgeted.

In the worst case scenario, even if life has other plans for me and I don't settle down at that place, I can always sell it back at (hopefully) appreciated price in the future.

10cgup0,MalaysianPF,1673779601.0,"Hi, so I guess I‚Äôm really having a burnout from my current job. I figure the reasons I want to quit this job so much are:

- it is a graveyard-shift job 10pm-7am and it has really messed up my sleeping schedule. I have been trying to sleep like an American for 6 months so far*, but still, I get just 4 hours of sleep everyday which is not enough for me (sometimes not even 4 hours).

- it is very inflexible on leaves. We don‚Äôt run any local public holidays and it is hard to apply for any sort of leaves. We don‚Äôt even have Compassionate Leaves. Last year, when my grandma passed away, my company asked me to use my Annual Leaves or Unpaid Leaves. 

- the job requires me to work non-stop (literally) throughout the entire 8-hours shift, not even a bathroom break. The only time I can take a bathroom break or rest is during the 1 hour break. Other than that, I am constantly working. 

- I don‚Äôt see any advancement in this job. The company also doesn‚Äôt provide the employees with any sort of benefits aside from the basic: AL, Medical Leaves, Hospitalisation Leaves. 

Also, because of the above (especially the sleeping time and graveyard shift) I don‚Äôt get to spend time with my family at all. 

I know working means spending less time with family but what I mean here is this job constrains me from even going back home over the weekends to visit my family because it runs a rotational shift. 

Now here comes the real question: 

I haven‚Äôt secured a new job yet and this current job comes with a 2-months notice period (quite long imo). 

Should I resign right now and job-hunt during the 2 months or should I secure one before resigning?

I am feeling kinda lost.

As I was doing my research, I came across this: [American Express Cashback Gold Credit card](https://www.maybank2u.com.my/maybank2u/malaysia/en/personal/cards/credit/amex_cash_back_gold.page?) offered by Maybank. It has an annual income requirement of RM30K, first year annual fee waived (RM75 subsequent) and here's the kicker, 1% cashback on all local spend (uncapped) and 1.5% on overseas spend. From the T&C yes, some services and all that are not eligible for cashback (which is the case for most cards anyways). But I am most impressed by the 1% cashback on local spend. 

Even if I move into the second year of owning the card, and am required to pay the annual fee (RM75), this means, I would have to spend at least RM7.5K per year to ""break-even"". But because of the blanket 1% cashback, this would mean I would get cashback on things that I am required to pay anyways for the month including: groceries, medical card, life insurance, petrol, gym membership (ALL UNCAPPED!). Already I am spending approximately RM1K on these per month which means, per year, it would total to RM12K and provide me with RM120 of cashback. Which, tbf is better than nothing. Minus the RM75 fee and I still end up with RM45 (a profit). My aim of owning a CC now is mainly to build credit and to get RM45 on top of it isn't much la but it's something. 

The thing is, I am wondering if I am being too narrow in my approach to this? Am I not considering something which I should? Is this a good deal? What are the opportunity costs to this CC? Are there downfalls to just focusing on cashback gains? What am I losing out with this CC?

I'm a freshgrad making RM3.2k after EPF & other standard deductions. I have no PTPTN/car loans/credit cards, and I aim to put away at least RM700 a month for savings. I currently rent for RM600 (including utilities) but in an area that has a 20 min walk to LRT (I take grabs during work emergencies), consistent water shortage (twice a month minimum), pest infestation, bad network connection making it a bit hard to WFH if needed, and a shared kitchen that's in bad shape (can't homecook as often). I also am long distance with my S/O so if they come to Selangor, they're not allowed over so we'd pay for a room outside (for several nights, so an additional RM200 per person, excluding food). 

I feel like I'm spending a lot on ad-hoc and temporary solutions to my problem. I am trying to save as much as possible now but I'd also need more stability for the sake of my mental health, as I go to work at 8AM in the morning and arrive home at 9PM because of the long commute.

I have three possibilities:  
1. RM1.3k studio at a spot very close to the LRT (compromising money)  
2. RM900 Master bedroom at a spot very close to the LRT (compromising privacy)  
3. RM1k studio that's further away from the LRT (will have to buy an electric scooter as the cheapest transport option to LRT, compromising safety)

The longer I stay at my current spot, the itchier I feel to spend more than 30% my income away on rent. I've been thinking about moving out since August 2021, but stayed to save money (and failed because of these ad hoc problems). I feel like my mental health is pretty whack right now, feeling a bit like ""cheap boots"" vs ""quality boots"" scenario.

1) My company has issued an EA form with 2020 salary amount. Do we need to upload this document when filing taxes? Or if not, is there any other purpose of this document beyond letting us know our annual salary?

2) I have started investing so how do we declare income for those? I invested in Stashaway Simple, ASM, ASM2, ASN Equity 5 and Public Mutual unit trusts. How do I know the amount that I have to declare for each?

3) For fixed deposit interests and bank interests, do we need to declare as income for those as well? If yes, do I just add all the interests I get on a monthly basis and declare that?

4) Does SOCSO and EPF tax reliefs automatically apply if my company deducts those amount from my monthly salary?

Would really, really appreciate any advice on how to save up for a house (doesn‚Äôt need to be in KL per se, I‚Äôve been surveying Sendayan but it‚Äôs too near Cenviro for my taste) as I prefer landed property, just as a personal preference. 

Below are my monthly expenses :-

- Great Eastern (life insurance) Rm212
- Prudential (life+savings investment) Rm311
- Dad Rm700
- PTPTN 750 
- Bank Islam personal loan Rm1200 (6 years left)
- Digi Rm70
- Rental Rm1400
- Public Mutual investments Rm400
- iCloud Rm12
- Transportation (petrol, parking) Rm500
- Food Rm50/day total Rm1500/month
- Electricity and water estimate Rm200

So my rough expenses monthly is around Rm7200-7300. It‚Äôs kind of pathetic and I need to supplement this income with locum (basically a sit-in doctor) which nets me around Rm2k+ extra per month before taxes (mostly overnight locum that leaves me looking like a zombie in the morning).

Any suggestions what I should do in order to allocate more savings aside monthly for a house or emergency funds? I have a 17 year old H.City fully paid off, I go on holidays probably once every 2 years (Thailand, Bali and the like), and I‚Äôve a girlfriend without plans for marriage anytime soon as the costs incurred will definitely take a chunk of dough.

Context:  
I currently have around 10k in ASB, about 2k + in emergency funds, and 800 in stashaway.

Most studio apartments I can afford is 15-20 mins driving distance away from my work place with no nearby public transportation, so I have no choice but to use car.  


Doubts:  
I'm unsure if I'm either over or underestimating certain spending aspects.   
I feel like I'm cutting it too close for leftover spending for ""rainy days"".  
I have to save less than I did if I'm living with my family, and the amount is less than the recommended 20% of income. 

  
Should I wait longer to leave or should I bite the bullet and go?

Let's face it, majority of our Malaysian young adults (late teens to early 30s) these days do not save enough (or at all), whether for retirement or for a goal in life. Instead, they go around spending money like there's no tomorrow. It pains me to see how much they ""splurge"" on themselves as if their parents are millionaires. 

I noticed there are not many local YouTube channels that are made exclusively for our country, therefore, I believe there may be a need for this to ensure us Malaysians are not left out.

Basically, this channel is to talk about career as well as personal financing, targeted towards Malaysian fresh graduates, millennial as well as Gen Z-ers (that don't mean audience from other countries cannot learn).  These videos are made based on my experience in the corporate/working world of over a decade, and I truly believe that it will be helpful to our younger audience and friends.

qb2q03,MalaysianPF,1634613321.0,"**UPDATE**: My mom mentioned today (19.3.2022) that, in less than a year, my dad has made USD2.4k through the scheme. He invested USD5k, which means he has made slightly under 50% in 5 months plus (9.x% per month). Based on u/jwrx's comment, that seems like a suspiciously large amount of returns. At any rate, he's going to wait and see how the US economy will be in the next year before cashing out. For his sake, I hope the money is more than just numbers on a screen.

A couple of days ago, my dad was informed by a friend about a forex trading scheme he was part of, and that my dad became interested in. He signed up, and he got my mom and two of his siblings (both in Australia) to send him photos of their IC and driver's licence so he could sign them up too. He wanted me to do the same, but I didn't know too much about it, so I asked some questions. I was also rather wary because watching him get people to sign up through him, and hearing that his friend had his four children sign up through him, made the whole thing sound almost like a pyramid scheme. His answers to my questions were vague and uncertain, and he couldn't tell me more about it that would help me look it up. He also said that if I didn't want to sign up it was fine, he'd still make returns, just not as much as if I signed up. Based on that, I refused to sign up because I didn't want to give up my docs for something I don't understand. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a lot of drama that's detailed in some other posts on my profile if you really wanna know.

I later asked my mom (who's also putting money into the scheme) about how it worked. The gist of it is that they're entrusting their money to a fund manager, who will open accounts and trade in their names (something like unit trust if I understand right). Once their account starts making returns, the investor can either take over and manage it themselves, or let the manager continue to handle it and just receive the returns. The purpose of getting other people's names and documents is for ""diversifying"" (which neither I nor she understood fully). Eventually she blew up because I was asking ""too many questions"" and ""why can't you just trust your father"".

I later asked two people for their advice, a lawyer and a person with a background in finance. Based on what they told me, this kind of thing is fairly common, but it's very risky and you either make it big or lose everything. The lawyer also told me that depending on the fintech platform being used, it was possibly not in compliance with Bank Negara exchange rates.

Based on what i know so far, I think I made the right call not caving in on this, but I'm still not sure because I don't understand it all. I'd appreciate if someone can basically explain like I'm five about forex trading and what it entails, whether it's common to have fund managers trade on your behalf, whether it's common to ask others for their documents to improve your investment and, ultimately, whether this whole thing is as fishy as it sounds or whether I'm just being paranoid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/qb2q03/dad_asked_me_to_share_photos_of_my_ic_and_licence/,Dad asked me to share photos of my IC and licence for a forex trading scheme.

nf00x5,MalaysianPF,1621308514.0,"Hi, I'm a single 26yo / bumi and started working since 2 years ago. I'm not sure how to start growing my money and practice healthy financial habits other than disciplined savings, build good credit, ASB and get medical and life insurance for protection. Standard stuff.

My financial breakdown :

Take-home pay : 3.4k/month

Asset : Savings (50k),... ASB (61k),... Epf relevant to include?? (29k)

Liability & commitments :

a. Car loan - 500/month (33k outstanding balance)  
b. ASB Financing - 300/month (56k outstanding balance)  
c. Credit cards - paid in full each month (avg. 800/month)  
d. Rent - 280/month  
e. Insurance premium - 200/month

Questions :

1. Are there any obvious financial mistakes I'm making here that I need to fix asap? 
2. Should I dump more money into ASB? 
3. What should I do first? Pay off ASB financing and car loan before taking on another investment product?
4. Financial goal - I have no specific financial goal other than to grow my money faster than basic savings account can do. I'm keeping an open mind about permanent relocation abroad, so for someone who is indecisive like me, is it beneficial to buy a property in... let's say... 5 years from now? Is it pointless to buy a property in Malaysia but end up retiring abroad?
5. Financial literacy goal - I'm not very financially literate but I'd like to start dibble dabble in medium to high risk faster return investment.

I think that both owning and renting come with their own pros and cons. Some of which include but not limited to (feel free to add on)

Renting

Pros: mobility, no long term commitment, more affordable in the short term 

Cons: lesser stability (landlord can ask you to move out with 2-6 months notice), landlord can increase rent, more expensive to rent in long term, no equity even if you were a model tenant and stayed for 20 years etc.

Owning

Pros: ownership of your own home (noted that share of ownership is pro rated / split with the bank until loan is fully paid off), more affordable in the very long run esp if you spot a very good deal that is undervalued below market rate in a prime area. Can rent out rooms to offset property costs.

Cons: more expensive upfront in the short term, have to find and manage tenants (if plan to rent out), physical asset has geographical limitations.

These pros and cons I‚Äôve stated above for renting / owning are just some at the top of my mind, do add on for a stimulating discussion.

To be honest, there are a lot of tips being circulated around here but it does get daunting still so pardon me on asking for more personalized tips here.

I'm a fresh grad with RM 4.5k salary and I only intend to spend RM 500-600 monthly on daily expenses.

I'll deduct RM 1k for my other expenses. Ex: giving some allowance back to my family and PTPTN repayment. 

I think I'll sign up for an 11% epf savings amount instead of 9%?

Have 1 no-touch long-term emergency fund account that I automate stashing money away into, perhaps FD? My mutual has recently introduced me to the PB mutual funds that offer good rates too and I'm looking into that as an alternative. For this section, I'll probably invest RM 1k monthly.

I currently am looking into investing in Stashaway and KDI and I think I'll set RM 1000 into this, or I don't mind setting RM 1000 for Stashaway and KDI each if the encouragement from here is good.

Phew, that's 4.5k gone. I want to work hard to save up enough to migrate overseas in a few years and I'm only back in Malaysia due to family.

My current car loan is RM15,280 and I am paying RM900 monthly. Expected to finish off by September 2023. I took a variable loan and there is a chance my loan rate will increase based on the OPR. 

If I opt for full settlement loan by this month, I will get a rebate of RM2580. Thus, my total car loan will be RM12,700.

The reason I want to take out RM10k is to settle of my car loan and focus on settling my RM30k PTPTN loan next. Also, I am afraid the OPR will increase and I need to fork out more money. Thirdly, I can get rebate of RM2.5k. It is not alot which comes to my next point. 

I do not want to take out the RM10k from EPF because I could earn dividends which may be higher than the rebate.

I really don't mean to make light of it by considering the idea of simulating it and having it be something I can technically opt in and out of.

This thought came from watching my peers in university who have had to struggle through it - renting a hostel, working part time and such just to get through university. Some of their struggles continue even today after going into the working world, needing to support parents and siblings, paying off rent, loans, etc.

In comparison to me, I still have student loans to pay off, but that's as far as it goes for now. I do not have to struggle for survival, as I still live under my parents paid-off house and plan to continue doing so because it just makes financial sense. My mum still has substantial savings from her early days working and I pay her 25% of my salary as monthly allowance. My dad ran into some issues with his business a few years ago which led to the deterioration of his financial situation, but he's currently trying out something new and hopefully it bears fruit - either way he's getting old as well and that's a reality that we all need to consider.

As for me, I'm currently in an entry level position that pays fairly. I'm able to comfortably allocate a portion of my salary to emergency savings and low risk investment portfolios. I am still a frugal person despite growing up in an upper-middle class childhood and early adolescence, always have been and even more so now that I'm privy to the financial situation of my family which has really gone downhill in the past few years (on paper my family now qualifies for B40), but my frugality was developed in a safe, comfortable environment. 

It's this comfort that unsettles me, even though I should feel grateful and privileged - because I feel like it can get pulled from under my feet at any time and I'd not have developed the skills and resilience that comes from growing up in a genuinely tough environment.

As such, I'm wondering if any of you have tried what I have in mind - that is to force myself to live as if I needed to fight for my survival? What I had in mind was to craft fake living expenses to channel into a savings/investment account? And if I end up in the red after deducting those fake expenses, I'd need to figure out just how to make up for it. Some people choose to develop this by simply moving out, renting a place and taking care of themselves - but I personally feel like that's just a really expensive lesson, since rent isn't exactly an insignificant sum.

Honestly, looking back, it just sounds like a very roundabout way of just having good financial management, and again, at the risk of making light of it as it's something I can opt out of easily, but I guess it's really about developing that sink or swim mindset that I feel could help me build more resilience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/pxm83q/has_anyone_tried_simulating_a_tougher/,Has anyone tried simulating a tougher life/financial situation in order to force yourself to grow?,General questions,36,12,0.94

But some positions have to be in the office, like people manager, customer service, hr.

This info is not to be used in court. Info and procedure can vary by state, my experience was in Selangor. Consult your own financial advisor, legal advisor or local Islamic offices for your own situations. I welcome any corrections from anyone more well versed in these matters.

You are welcome to share this info, but please link back to this post.

I have been requested to write on this subject. I have split it into several parts to simplify reading and discussion.

&#x200B;

**PART 1: Islamic estate management**

When a muslim in Malaysia passes away, there are 3 ways in which things can happen, based on the deceased person‚Äôs plan or lack thereof.

&#x200B;

**HIBAH**

This is a gift that is planned before death and given after death. Hibah CANNOT be contested, and can be given to anyone, even people outside the family including non-muslims. The asset must be solely owned by the giver, for example a property jointly owned or still under bank loan is not eligible. Hibah must be specified ‚Äì e.g. a specific property or bank account.

Hibah can be done through agents or some state Islamic depts. (Selangor Islamic dept has this service.) Certain institutions like ASB, Tabung Haji and Takaful insurance also provide hibah services for their products.


There is a fee to set up the hibah contract and also administrative fees will be charged when the hibah is put into effect after death (set fee for transfer of property, percentage fees for liquid assets). If the hibah recipient is under 18yo, the assets will be managed by an executor until 18yo.

The remainder of the assets not covered by hibah will be distributed by wasiat (if applicable) or faraid.

Please contact a hibah agent for further details, as I have no direct experience in this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **WASIAT**

This is the muslim version of a will. This CAN be contested if any of the legal heirs (waris) are not happy with the distribution, so you may want to make sure your waris agree with the distribution beforehand. Up to one third of the value of the estate can be given away outside the waris, again subject to waris agreement. If there is any contest to the wasiat, it will be nullified and the estate distribution will revert to faraid.

Wasiat can be done through Amanah Raya, private agents, some banks, and some state Islamic depts. (Selangor Islamic dept has this service.) There is a fee to set up the wasiat and also administrative fees will be charged and taken from the estate when the wasiat is put into effect after death ‚Äì set fee for transfer of property, percentage fees for liquid funds. You can make changes to your wasiat after it is set up, for a fee of course.

The wasiat executor will manage all the procedures and paperwork, deal with the banks, manage the court hearings, and pay off the debts from the estate before distributing the assets and transferring the ownership of properties.

Although comparatively faster than faraid, distribution of the bulk of the assets can still take a long while, depending on the complexity of the estate, although an executor may be able to release some cash earlier if needed. Assets that do have a ‚Äúpenama‚Äù (e.g. EPF/KWSP, Tabung Haji, insurance with named beneficiaries) can be withdrawn directly by the penama and distributed according to the wasiat without waiting for the rest of the estate to go through the process, and will not be charged the wasiat administration percentage fees. 

Wasiat bequeathments to children under 18yo will be held and managed by the wasiat executor until the child reaches 18yo (unless specified otherwise - further info coming in a subsequent part). Thus if the widow or guardian needs money to cover the child's costs, she will need to apply for the funds and wait for approval.

A comparison of wasiat fees by various companies (data may not be up to date as I just did a quick search, but this gives some idea):

&#x200B;

Amanah Raya:

Filing RM350

Administration of liquid assets:

The first RM25k - chargeable rate of fees: 4%pa  
25001- 225000 : 3%pa  
225001 - 250k : 2%pa  
250001 - 500k : 1%pa  
Value in excess of RM500k : 0.50%pa

&#x200B;

As Salihin

Filing RM1280

Administration of liquid assets:

The first RM1million - chargeable rate of fees: 1.8%pa (subject to minimum of RM5000)  
Value in excess of RM1million - 1%pa  
Value in excess of RM10million - 0.5%pa

&#x200B;

MAIS

Filing RM300

Administration of liquid assets:  
2% ¬†¬† ¬†= Nilai harta RM 25,000 pertama;  
1.5% ¬†¬† ¬†= Nilai harta RM 50,000 berikutnya;  
1%¬†¬† ¬†= Nilai harta RM 75,000 berikutnya;  
0.5%¬†¬† ¬†= Nilai harta RM 100,000 berikutnya; dan  
0.25%¬†¬† ¬†= Nilai harta RM 200,000 ke atas.

&#x200B;

There will be a further charge for each transfer of property ownership, and also various administrative and procedural costs. Check with each provider for complete and updated info.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **FARAID**

This is the default distribution under Islamic law. Assets left after debts are fulfilled are divided among the waris in set percentages, depending on the deceased person‚Äôs gender and the number of surviving waris and whether the deceased person has a son. This can be VERY complex, especially if the deceased person has no sons. Faraid calculator: [http://faraid.usm.my/msl/faraid.asp](http://faraid.usm.my/msl/faraid.asp).

Important to note: by faraid, if a husband passes, the widow gets a small portion compared to her kids, especially a son. A son gets double the portion of his sisters. If there is no son, a large portion actually will go to the husbands‚Äô relatives e.g. his brothers. The intention behind this was that if the widow was uneducated, the (adult) son or the husband‚Äôs relatives would manage that money to support the widow and the female children. But unfortunately, many just see their portion as their ‚Äúhak‚Äù (divine right) and ignore the responsibility that goes with it.

Also note, a widow can claim ‚Äúharta sepencarian‚Äù (a claim to property or funds acquired during the marriage), which will be taken from the estate before division of the remainder by faraid. But this is an extra process in court, which is complicated and takes time. (I have no experience with this. You will need to contact the court or a lawyer for more information on this, specific to your state.)

Due to the many and varying percentages, management of an estate under faraid can be very complex, if everyone is very set on getting their ‚Äúrightful portion‚Äù. Imagine if a family house was in the sole name of the now deceased husband, and the widow is unable to buy out other waris‚Äô portions of the house. The house ownership will have to be transferred to the names of all the waris, according to their various percentages by faraid. Then further imagine the hassle of trying to get everyone together to sign documents if the property is to be sold and most of the money will not go to the widow, or the further tangle if one of those waris passes away and that portion is handed down to their next layers of waris. Or possession of a vehicle ‚Äì this can only be in one person‚Äôs name, so the new owner would have to buy out all the other waris‚Äô portions to solely own the vehicle, unless the other waris all agree to give the vehicle to that one person. Not to mention the hassle to calculate and manage the portions of property vehicles belonging to underage children.

However, if all the waris agree, the distribution can be done in a more peaceful manner. For example, an estate where the only waris are an adult son and daughter, by faraid the son would get two thirds and the daughter one third. But they might discuss and agree to split the estate equally. Or they might agree that one person gets the house and the other all the liquid assets. Or another example, if a husband passes away leaving his parents, a wife, and small kids, his parents can choose to release their part of the estate to go the wife and kids. Unfortunately, all too often disagreements over division will happen and the process will be dragged out.

Also of note ‚Äì if a father passes away leaving a wife and children, while guardianship of the children will go to the widow, the portions of funds allocated to children under 18 are NOT automatically managed by the widow. Depending on the court order, the administration of the money may be assigned to the husband‚Äôs father or Amanah Raya. Thus, the widow will have to negotiate a monthly sum to be given to the family to cover the kids‚Äô expenses, and for large expenses the widow will have to go in person to apply for the extra funds, and wait for a week or two for the application to be approved!!!

It has taken a huge toll on me mentally as I now always dread going to work, I get breakdowns a few times a day which consist of tears and heavy breathing.

3. **But I will lose the interest?** Not really, just save RM1000 and set 2-3 months term, auto renewal. Here is a graph to show you:

Basically, it doesn't really matter which interest you choose. When it auto renews, the interests paid are reinvested and compounded over and over. The graph above shows that if you choose 6 months term over 60 months, you actually get more money 5 years down the road.

Alternatives Analysis:

1. **Savings account** \- It's liquid af, got the urge to spend it all, FD tucks it away making it slightly less liquid.
2. **StashAway Simple or other money market funds** \- Stable, but extremely illiquid. Takes 5 days to withdraw, that is very very bad for ""emergency fund"".

As the title says, i'm a 25 y/o, fresh grad, working for my first job. I'm from Sarawak and currently work in KL with a gross salary of 3.5k/month. My monthly expenses are:  
\-300 for fuel  
\-200 for tolls (job involves a lot of commuting)  
\-400 for food  
\-250 for mum  
\-40 for telecom bills  
\-100 for other stuff (hair cut, etc..)  
\-0 for car (car is an old 2011 but reliable proton saga)  


I haven't paid rental yet as i'm currently living in my aunt's house for the time being. My question is, what's the max amount of money if you were in my place, for rental + utilites? Is 650 too high? From my online searches, room rentals can be like rm 50-100 cheaper but far away (spend more on fuel, toll and worse, time) or too expensive for me to even consider. I found one which is about rm 650 per month for rental and utilities, and it is around 10 minutes of commuting to work.  


I've stayed at my aunt's house for almost a month now, but my aunt has been giving me a lot of subtle hints for me to move out, and i feel uncomfortable staying here any longer.

I plan to look for a job in KL due to the fact that there's a lack of Graphic designer jobs that accepts people with less than 1 year of experience in Johor.

So anyone has any idea of what the cost of living I'll be looking at for these basic things in KL?

Rent, electricity, water, food, transportation.

I applied for my 2nd job that requires 3+ years of experience (in Python alone), and fortunately I got the job. The payment was a lot better than my previous job, so initially I was very happy and felt really lucky to even get that position.

I worked normally then, but I was struggling with quite a few things for the first month. After 3 months, I am fully independent with whatever task given. I even started to be called here and there, which means they trusted me with 1 thing but used by multiple projects. 

After working for 4+ months, I just knew that my other colleagues (who did the same thing like me) are paid a lot more, which is at least 1.8x more than me. At this point I started to feel like I am underpaid compared to my workload. Thinking about this, I also just realised that my salary is merely a little bit over a fresh grad salary. 

Is there a way I can ask for increment? Do I reach my HR or manager for this? 

I'm not expecting the same salary with my other colleagues, since they are more experienced. Something 1.5x my current salary is great enough. And if they ask me why I wanted an increment, I have my own points to back me up.

Any thoughts?


UPDATE FOR ANYONE WONDERING THE SAME: I asked my HR last week how is it gonna go. I just asked her how is my probation status and she straight up get into that conversation so I got no awkwardness in asking how is the increment process. She said that the increment can be done when an appraisal process has been done, which is twice a year (June and Dec). And when the appraisal comes and I got to have an increment, I can request for the amount that I wanted. So, In order for me to request for an increment to the amount that I wanted, I will need to wait until at least December. I can go with that.

Maybe the process is different on different companies. I don't have to go to my manager because my manager just basically manage me on my tasks and my availability across multiple projects.

I enjoy tracking my expenses and thought of sharing how I manage my monthly cash flow here to inspire other young investors to kick start their journey to financial freedom. Welcoming any constructive feedback. FYI, I divide my money into three categories: Shrink, Sustain and Swell. 

SHRINK (60%) 

- Money that reduces my net worth every month 
- Two sub-categories: Fixed spendings and Controlled spendings 
- Fixed spendings: Recurrent payments that are fixed in amount like Netflix subscription or rental
- Variable spendings: Budgets that I want to stick to like budget for food or entertainment 
- Leftover money will be transferred to a ""Surplus"" account at the end of every month which I will use to invest in REITs once I hit 1000. This account is important as it incentives me to save more money every month. 

SUSTAIN (20%) 

- Money that I am using to maintain my net worth  
- Two sub-categories: Capital accumulation and Capital preservation
- Capital accumulation: Saving for different short term goals like a vacation or deposit
- Capital preservation: We all know that holding too much cash is not good because of inflation. Hence, I started this portfolio to invest extra cash for short term goals. The idea is to have a low volatile investment portfolio so one can withdraw from it without having to wait ages for market correction. This investment portfolio has two objectives: liquidity + low volatility. Without being too technical, a 100% bond portfolio can sometimes be more volatile than a 20% stock - 80% bond portfolio depending on the underlying assets. Interested individuals can go read up on MPT, efficient frontier, Sharpes ratio and Sortino ratio. 
- The amount of money I allocate to both categories vary every month. If I have met all my saving goals, I will allocate more money to capital preservation. 

SWELL (20%) 

- Money that I am using to grow my net worth 
- Capital appreciation: Investing in Vanguard global all cap index fund 
- Consistent income: Pension contribution 
- I allocate the same amount of money to both sustain and swell accounts because I believe that saving for the present is as important as investing for the future.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**PART 2: Procedure upon death of a family member**


‚Ä¢ 1. Nominate one person to be in charge, usually the surviving spouse or a close relative, if possible living in the same state as the deceased, whom I will refer to as ‚Äúyou‚Äù in the following. 


‚Ä¢ 2. You first need to apply for the Death Cert from JPN ‚Äì bring the deceased person‚Äôs IC and the death paperwork from the hospital or police report if the person passed at home.


‚Ä¢ 3. If you/the family/dependants are in desperate need of cash, you can immediately bring the death cert and collect ‚Äúkhairat kematian‚Äù (benevolent payment upon death) from bodies such as KWSP/EPF, PTPTN, PERKESO/SOCSO, FELDA, or ASB, where applicable to eligible contributors/account holders, to be used for burial expenses or urgent family expenses. Check with each body for eligibility and amounts. This is to only be redeemed once from each organisation.


‚Ä¢ 4. Find out if there was any hibah or wasiat. If yes, contact these executors and follow their instructions. Any assets under hibah will be given to the recipient very fast, minus any administrative steps and costs. Assets not covered by hibah will be subject to wasiat or faraid, and follow the next steps.


‚Ä¢ 5. Collect financial and asset info ‚Äì property details and if still under loans, accounts with which banks and amounts in each account, insurance details, stocks and share info, KWSP etc. You (or the wasiat executor) may need to contact each bank in person for this info. 

Pray the deceased person kept good records and didn‚Äôt stash money in every single variant of bank in msia, as each bank has their own different procedures and some banks may even require you to go in person to the home branch where the account was opened. 

Start to add up the value of the estate. You will need this info to determine your path in later steps.

Also start collecting family documents like birth/death certs, marriage certs etc.

‚Ä¢ 6. If the deceased has named ‚Äúpenama‚Äù on things like KWSP/EPF, insurance, and Tabung Haji accounts, the penama can bring the death cert and apply to withdraw the funds. Some banks may also release small accounts, under 10K, with just the death cert. Procedure varies by bank. 

HOWEVER, this money is NOT the sole property of the penama/withdrawer. It is to be held in trust, to be distributed according to the terms of the wasiat or faraid or mutually agreed distribution. ALSO, division of the estate is to be calculated AFTER payment of any debts. 

Thus, if cash is needed for urgent family expenses, ensure to keep records and only use the portion that is rightfully yours pending finalization of the estate. It is your amanah (responsibility) to ensure each waris receives what they are entitled to, and not to use funds belonging to others.


‚Ä¢ 7. You will probably need to apply for a Sijil Faraid. Contact the Islamic Dept of the STATE THAT THE DECEASED PERSON RESIDED IN for that state's forms and requirements. 

For Selangor, at the time i dealt with this, the person filing the form must also be a resident of Selangor. I do not know what the process would be if no other close relatives live in Selangor (maybe the next of kin has to hire a lawyer?), or whether other states also have this requirement.

The next steps in this process are determined by the value of the estate and the procedure of that particular state.


7a. For Selangor, If the estate of the deceased is less than I think RM100k, consisting of only liquid assets (no property/vehicle) and only has first level waris, you may not need a Sijil Faraid. Check with your state Islamic dept. 

However, depending on the amount in each bank and that bank‚Äôs procedures, to withdraw the money you may still need a Surat Kuasa (Letter of Authority), and you may need a sijil faraid to apply for that. Check with each bank involved, and relevant local authority.

7b. For Selangor, if the estate is worth over RM100k or includes immovable property, you will definitely need a Sijil faraid. (If there was a wasiat, the executor may do this on your behalf. Do note that even with a wasiat, a sijil faraid is still needed to verify all the waris and note the percentage they would receive by faraid, as the agreement of all the waris is required for the wasiat to be processed.) 

The sijil faraid form will list all the documents needed. Collect family birth/death/marriage certs of all the waris as listed in the forms. You may need to go to JPN to apply for cabutan sijil kematian for distant relatives, or relatives whose death certs were lost. If  some documents do not exist, for example if your deceased parent's grandparents died before merdeka so there was no documentation, relatives may need to do akuan bersumpah that the grandparents passed away.

For Selangor, estate valued at between RM100-300k goes to mahkamah rendah Syariah, over RM300k goes to mahkamah tinggi Syariah. The filing must be done in the state where the deceased resided, so check with that office for their local forms and requirements. You CAN do this yourself without a lawyer if you reside in the same state (for Selangor), your case is fairly straightforward and you have most or all of the documents.  You will need to file the forms and then apply for a hearing. It can be done in one hearing if you have all the paperwork, but the judge may request extra info and require additional hearings. There will be a filing fee and also another fee before the cert is given out.


‚Ä¢ 8. The next steps depend on the value of the estate and where the deceased person lived or where any landed property is located, as each state may have different procedures. Contact your state Islamic dept and/or district Pejabat Tanah (Land Office) for further info.

For Selangor, at the time of my dealings and if my memory serves me correctly, if no wasiat:

8a. Estate total value under RM600k and no immovable assets (property/vehicle) ‚Äì has to be administered by Amanah Raya. They will charge a percentage of the liquid assets, starting I believe at 5% for the first RM25k (which I think is just awful to charge people who don‚Äôt have much money and had no choice in the matter), percentage reduces after that. 

8b. Estate under RM600k but has immovable assets, or estate between RM600k-2m, with NO wasiat is considered harta pusaka kecil. This will go to district Pejabat Tanah (Land Office) for administrative review and to get the surat kuasa. You will need to call the Pejabat Tanah closest to the deceased‚Äôs residence to get further info, as not all pejabat tanah have seksyen pembahagian pusaka kecil, and procedures and forms may differ by state. 

If your case is not complicated and all the waris are in amicable agreement to follow faraid or all agree to another division, you should be able to do this without a lawyer, depending on the procedure for that state. If there are disagreements among the waris you may need lawyer(s). The pejabat tanah will hear the case and appoint an executor from among the waris (if in agreement) or an outside executor if needed (whom you will have to pay), who will be given a Surat Kuasa to transfer the land ownership and withdraw the liquid assets to first pay off debts and then remainder to be distributed according to the agreed terms.

8c. Estate value over RM2m, or has a wasiat no matter the value of the estate, is considered harta pusaka besar and will go to Mahkamah Tinggi Sivil. If wasiat, the wasiat executor will handle it all for you, this is what they are paid to do. Without a wasiat, you will need to hire a lawyer, you cannot do this by yourself. You can apply to be appointed executor (but you will need 2 guarantors each with assets of RM2m, though you can apply to waive this requirement), or the court can appoint an executor (who will charge a percentage of the estate).


‚Ä¢ 9. You or the lawyer must file the case to be heard. It may take several hearings. The Pejabat Tanah or Mahkamah Tinggi Sivil will issue a Surat Kuasa to the executor of the estate. 

If under wasiat, the wasiat executor will withdraw funds and close accounts, pay off any remaining debts, transfer property or vehicle titles, and distribute the funds.

If no wasiat, this duty will fall to you if you are appointed administrator of the estate and given the Surat Kuasa, or the pejabat tanah/court will appoint an independent administrator if needed.


&#x200B;

**DO NOT DELAY.** 

It is your amanah (responsibility) to wrap up the estate of a deceased person as soon as possible. Firstly, so that dependents can get the funds they are entitled to as soon as possible. But also, because if a waris passes away before the estate is settled, the procedure becomes MUCH more complicated when you have to take into account the new layers of waris of the recently deceased waris.

&#x200B;

**Estimated Timeline**

An estate distributed by wasiat can take 5 ‚Äì 18 months to be settled, depending on the complexity of the estate and the efficiency of the executors.

An estate under faraid that is simple and has only a few legal waris who are happy with the default division or have come to mutual agreement on the division, can be settled within maybe 10 ‚Äì 18 months.

An estate under faraid that is complicated and has many layers of waris can take SEVERAL YEARS to be settled. 

&#x200B;


**CONCLUSION**

The process to deal with the estate of a deceased loved one is long and arduous. Especially when there has been no financial estate planning. Thus, it is vitally and especially important for anyone with dependents (elderly parents or wife and kids who depend on you as breadwinner) to strategise your estate management in order to plan for emergency funds to be immediately accessible, to minimize the time taken to settle the estate, and make the process easier for your grieving family.

I will share some basic steps anyone can take to optimise your estate planning in Part 3.

I want to choose a stock where I can put RM100 /month and just forget about it and let it be. I was thinking of buying either Genting or Maybank, but as you can tell, I'm not very knowledgeable on these things.

I know most recommendations are to build emergency fund, then max out ASNB, then put everything else in EPF.

Just some context, Im (23) currently in my second year in the workforce making MYR4.5k/month (MYR3.8k+ nett) and I'm expecting to receive a 2 months bonus early next year and a promotion as well. My current job is practising hybrid working environment (2 days in the office) and I plan to work here for the next 1-2 years. My commute to the office is about 30-45 minutes one way.

&#x200B;

My parents recently offered to get me a new car (fully paid) with a budget of 60k. I was wondering if it's a good idea to get a new car? My current car is 6 years old (115k+ km) and it's still working well (last repair costed me MYR600, nothing major....yet). However, my parents are pushing me to get a new car with better safety features. I don't have any commitments/debts right now except insurance which is MYR200/month. I have also not started investing yet as I'm still saving up for my emergency fund. I have about 7k in savings now and 2 credit card which I pay off in full every month.

I was wondering if I should negotiate with my parents to put the money in index funds/ETFs instead? As I don't think it's wise to purchase a brand new car when my current car is still running. A reason why they did not opt to put the money in the stock market/ETFs instead is because they are afraid that I will withdraw the money and blow it away on my vices.

Diploma in Engineering with bad CGPA.

Earning 3k+, monthly basic 2.4k + auto OT (never below 3k).

House loan 35years RM1416, recently increase from 1.2k+ make me quite stress about it (never knew that loan installment can increase and this is definitely a bad decision, can't really go back now).

No other loan or cc.

Monthly commitment around 1.2k = food + internet + bills + petrol etc

30k kwsp + 10k all money that i have




Roughly leave me with around 400+ monthly need to save most of it for car and motorcycle, insurance + maintenance 




Not asking how to invest money because i don't earn that much 

Asking what can i do with myself?

1st
Do i continue with degree? I know I'm not that smart, i don't even know what the difference between degree and diploma before and now I don't even know what the difference between postgraduate and undergraduate degree lol. Also this will cost me quite a lot and i can't afford it without loan. And if i can't catch up and need to drop out, it'll just add more burden with the loan.


Is there a better way if i need to continue study?




2nd
My second option is business(street vendor) I don't know anything about business and my plan is just save enough and buy everything i need, get someone i trust (SO) to take care of the stall while i keep working so i can keep up with the loss before it can grow. And figure everything else from there.


Is this good enough or business is not that easy?




Or is there anything else you want to suggest to me like draw furry p0rn or something(not that I'm not considering lol) that i can just add just a little bit more to my earnings so i can just live comfortably.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/ynpjhy/how_can_i_improve_my_earnings/,How can i improve my earnings?,Career,33,52,0.92

&#x200B;

I bought a great eastern life insurance (SMARTPROTECT ESSENTIAL INSURANCE 2) in 2019 with monthly payment 200.

During that time, i was abit messy and i done the deal with the agent very quickly on the first meet. The agent was my boss's friend so instead of  believe on the agent, i more blindly believe in my boss during that time.

And recently i finally get out from the messy mind, and i try to review back my financial status. I try to contact back the agent and ask about the policy details but he act very no patience and keep on asking me to upgrade to a more expensive plan without brief me the detail clearly.

His strategy was like ""you need to care for your family, better coverage plan"". But when i ask about the cost and t&c, he keep avoid to answer me and ask me to read from the official banner.

I abit get high blood pressure with his attitude, is it possible to complaint to great eastern and ask for a better agency support to switch him out?

also, is it possible to reduce monthly due for a insurance?

u4ncq9,MalaysianPF,1650074271.0,"For many years, I have a really big fear of investing, so didn't do anything but listen to friends and invest in Unit trust. After getting fed up of the funds' blah performance and paying my fund agent money just to do nothing, I decided to just bite the bullet and learn about investing.

I started to dabble here and there, trying different ways to invest - from robo advisors, to finally getting a brokers account. First DCAing in roboadvisors then slowly, slowly investing in local stocks and REITs then US ETFs.

It was tough breaking through the fear. And so much of information out there so I was always overwhelmed, gah! But here's the investment strategy that I've designed for 2022. 

**LONG-TERM GOAL:** Coast FIRE in 10 years. The aim is to still work in 10 years, but not full time (freelance). To have \*some\* income from my non-EPF investments.

**GOALS IN 2022**

**Goal 1:** To increase my international exposure from 28% to 40% (I'm counting EPF's 36% international stock exposure also)

**Goal 2:**  To rebalance my portfolio. Remove money from underperforming funds and funnel more cash into investments. I have way too much in cash, which I suppose is a good problem to have during these uncertain times. 

Goal portfolio by 2020:

Local (including EPF) investments - 60%, Foreign investments - 40%

Planned asset composition:

*Local investments - I plan to let EPF do most of my local investing for me. They're smarter than me lol*

* REITs - AXISREIT, SUNREIT, ATRIUM
* Stock: Maybank
* ABF Malaysia Bond Index Fund (ABFMY1) just to balance things out
* Versa (money market)
* KDI (money market)
* Fixed deposits everywhere lol 
* Public mutual local small caps investment. <-- will liquidate some to shift to foreign funds or local REITs. Courage willing I'll nix it altogether.

*International investments*

* $VXUS
* $VTI
* $BND + $BNDX
* Stashaway - risk portfolio all over the place lol. Currently highest at 18%. I'm not sure what to put lah to be honest.
* Wahed - HLAL ETF mostly
* [Tradeplus MSCI Asia Ex Japan Reits Tracker](https://tradeplus.com.my/msci-jpn-reits)

I have a teeny tiny amount in crypto. I'm not a fan.

As you can see from my plan below, I'm mostly a conservative investor. This is due to my short time horizon. I plan to Coast FIRE in 10 years. If possible, 5 years - I will continue to work, but part-time or freelance, with my income just covering my expenses while my investments compound over time until 65 when I 100% retire.

I am 19 years old, now in my 3rd year of studies in Computer Science and Statistics. Through MCO, I got interested in business and finance hence realized the need and importance to manage my own personal finance. I read up a bit of investment through books and researching online, and was particularly interested in value-investing. But, that's not for now since I don't have the capital and would admit that I don't have sufficient knowledge to do so yet, maybe in the next few months, after I am confident, I would dabble into it.

Currently, I am taking a gap year before going into uni again due to the pandemic, hence I have been taking internships to gain experience and with that, I had myself, my first salary. My parents had also finally given me full control of the money in my bank account which mostly consists of Ang Paus money (\~20k) stored in FD for a long time.

After some research, I heard about the lucrative return of ASNB for Malaysians and managed to invest around 15k in the range of ASMs. Besides that, I had also leverage on the government incentive of i-saraan and put in around 1750 into it. I also tried robo-advisors such as Stashaway and set up an auto-debit of 250 a month.

After more research, ASNB returns had been decreasing year by year, and I wanted to reinvest my money elsewhere. Right now, I am treating ASNB as my 'high-interest saving account'. So, where else could I diversify my portfolio to achieve higher returns? As a young adult, my risk appetite is larger and I am going for a long term investment.

Your advice is very much appreciated, thank you :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/jhrjrd/19_nonbumi_need_advice_for_long_term_investment/,"19, Non-Bumi, Need advice for long term investment",,34,26,0.98

I started my fitness biz in my early 20s. Started off with just me and my trusty Proton Sage, Survived the pandemic and now I'm here.   


For the past 24 months my income average about RM12-15k a month. And in the past 24 months I took on a few more jobs as well. I do Online training, which I charge RM400 a month  and also another job whereby I coach corporate and give fitness related talks and speech ( Sadly I'm getting laid off as the company is contracting ), oh and I'm a part time property agent too, I sell/rent 2-3 houses a year as  supplementary income and also a way to meet more people.   


Anyways approaching my early 30s ... I realize I'm a little lose, and I'm not too sure where to go moving forwards.   


There are many days where I just lay down in bed and think ... what the F am I doing with my life and where am I suppose to go moving forwards. As all my job requires a lot of my time , effort and energy. There is no automation.  
Anyways here are some ideas I have moving forwards after talking to a few friends 

1. Go in harder with property as the ceiling for income is much much higher. Upwards of 20-30k if I go all in... but I'm not super passionate in this field.
2. Start a Youtube channel. I'd been talking about this for years ... but I'm just not very good at editing. Will slowly learn .

Hi - I am a 27F(non-bumi) and have been working abroad in HK for 3 years, my monthly salary is around RM110k and will increase according to a fixed scale if I stay on at this job/firm (jump from Nov last year after I qualified, was previously only around 20k). My goal is to achieve FAT Fire in 8-10 years time. I have a much older steady bf who makes around the same amount and we have no immediate plans to have kids, might enjoy DINK life forever or earliest I will consider having kids is when I am in my mid 30s. My current expenses and investments are listed below and would appreciate thoughts from the financial gurus here on how I can improve my financial position/portfolio.

Investments:

EPF - I just started self contributing and there‚Äôs around RM83k 

Stashaway - (horrible decision and I stopped putting in money monthly after they sold KWEB at its lowest =.=) RM56k

IBKR - around RM64k in equities (US ETFs, U.K. and SG REITs) 

Manulife (it‚Äôs HK version of EPF where you save for retirement but it‚Äôs saved in investment products/funds instead) - RM99k 

HSBC equities acc - mix of US index funds and HK equities (ETF and dividend stocks) RM 192k 

Cash: RM90k but mainly saving to pay my tax bill in January 

0 debt - I pay off my credit card bills in full each month and only big expense I had recently was buying my mum a new car which was fully paid in cash (around RM130k) 

Monthly Expenses:

Monthly rent: RM9.7k (HK rent is expensive and this is considered reasonable by HK standards for a 700 sq feet place, I share rent with my bf and this is my share)

Mum‚Äôs allowance: I am the only child and the sole provider for my mum, RM 3.5-5k (I give more during special occasions/birthdays), I also cover my mum‚Äôs health insurance premiums and fitness classes which cost an additional RM1k. Looking to possibly buy a small apartment for my mum in the next 1-2 year‚Äôs time.

Fixed investments: RM10-20k EPF voluntary contribution (I only started self contributing since July since I managed to go home to set up the relevant online acc and plan to max out the 100k allowance each year); RM12.7k gets deducted automatically on a monthly basis to buy US index funds and HK equities, RM36k gets deducted annually for voluntary Manulife MPF contribution which is tax deductible, whenever I have spare cash I dump money into IBKR to buy ETFs and my cash balance is usually kept quite low as I have no debt repayments 

Bills: ~RM1.2k (electricity, wifi, Spotify, YouTube premium etc.)

Insurance premiums: RM2.8k annually (tax deductible health insurance); RM13k annually (critical illness coverage) 

Food: one of my biggest expenses because I don‚Äôt cook and occasionally we go out for fine dining ~ RM10-15k

Transport: ~ RM500 (MTR and taxis, don‚Äôt own a car and don‚Äôt intend to)

Personal trainer: ~ RM2.4k

Miscellaneous: ~ RM3-5k

I try my best not to have lifestyle creep and my bf and I are quite frugal by HK standards. I do like to splurge on traveling and nice food but the impending recession has caused me to feel the urge to increase my savings rate- my portfolio returns have all turned red (where they were previously green) and I am keen to buy the dip. Looking to build a steady stream of income from dividend stocks (in HK, U.K. and Sg in order to diversify sources of FX) and only consider purchasing low cost properties in cash for rental returns (in the next 3-5 years) given the high interest environment. I used to be fixated on buying property as my parents are in the industry but don‚Äôt think the thesis makes sense in the current economic environment. Not too worried about becoming homeless as bf owns property in the U.K. that is fully paid off. 

With interest rates going up, also looking to park some cash in some short term FDs.

I grew up without much money and this has led to a lot of financial insecurities (also why I am quite averse to debt), my job is relatively stable (I am a lawyer) and thus would like to achieve FI asap in order to not worry about money‚Ä¶Would appreciate any advice on how I can restructure my portfolio or tweak my investment strategy.

Just a quick breakdown of my financial situation:

Monthly Wages: ~3.4-3.8k nett including a part time side job. 

Current savings/cash assets: 
~25k+ in MYR and another ~2k+ AUD in an Australian bank account from studying and working abroad.

+ About RM500 in stashaway and RM200 in T&G Go+ (just started these recently), and a couple grams of gold and silver I bought before the pandemic. 

Monthly expenses: 
Phone bill + entertainment subscriptions: RM80

Food: Been hovering ~RM200 since lockdown, saved quite a bit compared to eating out. 

I am fortunate enough to be able to stay with my parents so I don't have to pay rent or electricity bills, and they are not expecting any money from me for now as I just started working this year. 

Recent/future big expenses:
I have recently blown ~RM1000 on a monitor + keyboard as it is quite inconvenient working with a 14"" company laptop when I usually have around 4-5windows open at the same time. 
And I'm also looking to spend another ~5k on a desktop computer soon as prices are projected to increase until around 2023 from what I've been reading. (But that's close to 2months of my salary and I'm wondering if that's a wise move). 
Other than that, I'll probably have to look for a car sometime within a year or 2 as I'll have to commute to work when the pandemic ends.

A little background about myself. Im 20 ish and have a year left till i graduate from my bachelors degree (business major). I come from a borderline middle-class family and have few siblings, so naturally we're trying to make ends meet with little reserve left especially during this mco period where I couldnt find any part time jobs. Frankly speaking, im very afraid that I couldn't land a job after I graduated, unable to support my family etc. 

The story continues where I've been applying for any government financial aid that is available because im struggling to pay for my college tuition since PTPTN loan is not enough to cover the fees (needs another 2k every sem) and recently, I heard that my dad's business isn't doing all that well to the point that he had put the house up for collateral. My mom had an argument once and that time, I found out that my dad never specify where the 100k from the collateral went. I feel so damn insecure and seriously anxious about what's soon to come.

So, I was hoping that some of you have any advice for me to overcome this financial situation and what I should do in the future.

10ov7m5,MalaysianPF,1675061234.0,"Hi everyone! I got some fantastic feedback on my last post and here is what I plan to be my final last bit of thinking about this.

Strap yourself in because this is going to be quite an analysis. But I've put a lot of thought into this, so even if you don't have any suggestions, I hope you can at least learn from my experience.

For some context, I've spent about more than half a year looking at cars. I've viewed cars, taken them to mechanics to get checked. Yet none of them turned out to be very good or even acceptable in my opinion. I'm not looking for a fancy car, but it has to be safe, reliable and relatively comfortable (not jerking, vibrating a lot).

At this point, I'm quite tired and stressed, so here is where I am and I have decided that I will be making a decision soon:

My budget used to be RM12k. This was based on a very conservative 3 months of salary. I choose this because I much rather put money into buying my first home (which I plan to do in the next 3-4 years) and/or investing. I'm generally very very thrifty and wise with my money, but I'm not a miser. I spend money on things that are important (family, my health) and things I really enjoy (music, cooking). And for things that are important, I don't mind spending more as long as it's good quality.

But for a car, I just see it as something to get from point A to point B. And prior to the last 2-3 years, RM12k could get me a decent 7-8 year old car.

However, with current second hand market conditions, the cars I was seeing at that range were much older (11-12 years) and upon inspection, poorly maintained.

While I want to be thrifty, I still want to make sure I spend my money wisely. Which is why I am very insistent on getting a second hand car that is well maintained and going to a lot of effort to check and make sure before buying.

My current car (2007 Saga) is running alright but it vibrates very badly and it's a manual. I can get stuck in a one hour jam these days and it's just torture.

I absolutely want to change my car, so I upped my budget to RM17k (which I can pay cash) for a 2014-2016 car.

I'm looking at either a Hyundai i10 or a Saga.

If you go to mudah right now, put in a max mileage of 90k, RM10-20k and narrow down to Sagas for that year... There's literally only one car. And I've tried contacting them since last week and can't get an answer.

The next best is a 2017 Saga at... RM25k.

I have also recently viewed a 2013 i10. It's 11 years old, 130k mileage. Going for RM16k. I checked it's service records when I viewed the car and it was taken to Hyundai SC until 90k mileage which was Dec 2018. The car looks very well maintained.

So here are my current options:

1. Buy the 2013 i10. Maybe I can nego down 3-4k. And then put aside RM5k for repairs. Which would fit my budget. However, I've joined the Hyundai i10 group for some time and read a lot about the car. Reviews are very polarising. Some Malaysians feel don't ever buy the i10. Some feel it's a very good quality car. One thing everyone agrees is that parts are more expensive compared to Proton/Perodua, so even with a low price must take into account repairs. As I said, I can set aside RM5k for repairs. I will keep the car for about 5 years and then probably buy a 6-7 year old Saga at that time. I imagine by then the second hand market is better.

However, I'm worried at that age/mileage I might end up spending more than RM5k in repairs. Or that I might have to keep going to the workshop. I don't mind if I have to go in for repairs say once or twice a year. But if every few months... That's just too much time and effort.

I am going to get it checked by a mechanic soon. If they say it has problems, then I won't buy and will probably move to the 2nd choice. But if they say it's good, do you think it's a good buy?

Aside from that...

2. Buy a brand new Saga. My family was talking to me and said given the current second hand car market, why not just buy new. This was something totally foreign to me. I always have been a buy second hand car kinda person.

The thought of buying a new car just didn't make sense to me, the car depreciates the moment you drive it off the lot. Makes more sense to buy a 6-7 year old one, as long as well maintained.

But like I said, given current market conditions... I'm beginning to feel this might make more sense. With a loan, the car will cost RM42-44k (approximately). I will probably keep it for 10-15 years, so that I absolutely max out it's worth. I will still be paying much more for a car than I originally wanted to, but I'll get a good car and won't have issues for a long time. And I take very good care of my cars, so even when I eventually sell I think I'll get a good price.

Only thing is... My current salary even if I take a 6 months salary car, it's not going to reach RM42k even. Most to most a RM30k car (if the number seems different than the above 3 months 12k well... I got an increment last week and to summarise, it's one of the best increments I have ever got). With my new increment, I can afford the monthly repayment of a new saga. But that's only on a 9 year loan. I've heard some people say you should only take a car if you can afford to pay off in 5 years.

Plus, if I take a loan for a new Saga (as opposed to cash for the i10) I wonder how that will affect me in 4-5 years when I want to take a loan for a house.

I've (41m) been working with a local nonprofit org for abt 15 years, and due to the nature of the organization, resources are thin, and I usually step in to fill the gaps where needed/required and staffs from other depts step in to assist me. I'm an IT mgr by title, but my roles span from donor relations to finance and administration/operations/HR and anywhere in between.

I felt that i'm not growing nor developing as I'm constantly required to step-in or fill the gaps (n putting out fires) , and as the organization grows, it became much of a distraction to my main IT role, which I'm still fully responsible for.

I‚Äôm currently undertaking my internship at one of the Big 4 company and will be concluding my internship in 2 weeks time. I‚Äôve also undertaken multiple internships concurrently whilst studying before.

Here are the list of offers I‚Äôve gotten so far:

Offer 1 
- Foreign UK Bank
- Role: Management Trainee, Priority Banking
- Pay: RM5,500 + Annual Bonus 15%

Offer 2
- GLIC
- Role: Capital Market Executive, (Fixed Income Analyst)
- Pay: RM4,000

Offer 3
- Local Investment Bank
- Role: Management Associate, Client Coverage (FO)
- Pay: RM3,000

I‚Äôm an Accounting graduate and have always been fascinated with investment or capital market related topic. 

As you can see above, the highest offer from the list is the foreign bank which pays RM5,500. But I‚Äôm not really keen on the role (Retail Banking) which from the job description that was provided, I‚Äôll be exposed to relationship management or sales task, catering more to affluent/wealthy people.

The second and third offer really enticed me as both of the roles are related to capital market which I‚Äôve always been wanting to start my full time career with. The third company pays significant low than the first.

So guys, I would appreciate some advice to help me decide which path should I pursue. Should I pursue the first offer cuz the pay is good or perhaps the other two offers which are more aligned to my goal? 

And do yall think retail banking has any great exit opportunities in the future? Of course I‚Äôll do my research too but I would appreciate some insights from here as well.

hrhwcg,MalaysianPF,1594791332.0,"Hi MalaysianPF!

My partner has a staff of \~5 people, all young and single. They are great employees, but don't know much about financial planning, investing, making their money grow rather than spending them, etc. I had this idea of organizing a coffee chat, of maybe 1-2 hours, where someone could come in and talk to us about financial planning basics. My goal is to get them to understand about investing for the future and what tools are available to them so they can start to be financially responsible now, rather than later. Really basic and general stuff, but perhaps overlooked because most of us take it for granted. Less of ""invest your 2k in X money market fund and buy Y units of ABC mutual fund"" and more of ""here's how you can invest RM100 per month and why that's important. Here's are some roboadvisors and their benefits and risk. Here's a tool from EPF that allows you to do this automatically"" etc.

This idea came about because there is a huge gap in knowledge that I cannot help to plug. I myself am only now becoming more aware of unit trusts, roboadvisor, EPF investments and such. It's a big body of knowledge that is overwhelming for most people, myself included. My family has never emphasized these things, and I didn't cultivate an interest in it until I'm in my 30s. The employees are in their 20s, and I hope this can foster a stronger sense of fiscal responsibility so that they will be successful in the future, and as they go on to have families of their own.

It's just a barely formed idea in my head so what I'm thinking is start with a 1-hour coffee chat in a cafe, talking about basics in savings, investing and so on. I would need guidance myself on how best to organize this, and what topics should be tackled first, so I'd love to hear your thoughts. The only stipulation I have is that you are objective and not trying to sell something that you have a vested interest in.

Is this something that anyone would be interested in?

zlq1ui,MalaysianPF,1671021947.0,"So I recently met an insurance agent to get my medical card. I read that lots of netizens strongly advised against getting an investment-linked plan. They argued that the extra money that goes into the premium unnecessarily could be invested by yourself/used for better purposes.

Basically, my agent explained that the ILP investments are used to hedge against increasing insurance premiums -- we are basically paying more premium under ILP with some guarantee that we will be paying the same amount like 10, 20 years later. This is compared to increasing annual premium under the regular medical card (and there is no knowing how much % increase yearly). Not to mention that ILP has more benefits including waiver. But it's not like you get investment returns out of it. The returns are only used to reduce/maintain your premium.

It seems like both plans average out and you will be paying the same amount more or less over the same coverage period. Is there something I have missed, or did I get fed the wrong info? Interested to know how others choose their insurance.

For reference, my annual salary is around 70K, and we settled at a RM200 ish monthly payment (ILP). If I get the regular card, it will only cost me around RM100. I am very tempted to settle for the cheaper monthly payment tbh. I'm also scared of overpaying for insurance. Wanted to apply for online insurance without agent at first, but the coverage offered for online plans isn't that high.

Separate question: I am now (very) casually looking into critical illness and personal accident coverage. Is it ok to have insurance from different providers? Or more cost/time-effective to buy everything from one? I saw the e-lindung critical illness scheme under EPF lately, and it looks interesting. Coverage is not that high, but premium is way cheaper. It's under another insurance provider though.

Sorry for the long wall of text. Thanks for reading a noob's post!

-1.8k rent, -2k monthly personal expenditure (at most, can be MUCH lower), CTOS ‚ÄúVery good‚Äù, no existing loans, no outstanding credit balance, no intention to buy a car or have a family.

The reason I am now considering to buy a unit for ownstay is after my landlord just increased rent by 10% (probably due to OPR shenanigans this year) and I don‚Äôt want to continue paying for someone else‚Äôs mortgage especially if it‚Äôs going to increase that much every year. I lead a simple life and have no interest in travel or luxury goods. I only want a comfortable place for myself and I think I‚Äôve found it.

The only problem is that it isn‚Äôt <500k (which I assume is what most people would consider for a first home) so I wouldn‚Äôt be eligible for stamp duty waiver, etc. BUT this freehold built-up unit has just been released by the developer and I have placed a booking for it because I can really see myself staying there long-term and have the option of 0% DP + 0 legal fees (stamp duty still have to pay). I am currently waiting for responses from a few banks that I‚Äôve applied to and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll get 100% (bank valuation of the unit is above selling price) or even 90% at a decent interest rate.

Based on mortgage calculators online, I would have to fork out approx. 3k/mth for instalments based on a 700k loan. Not to mention utilities and maintenance at 500/mth. I still have the option of placing a higher DP to reduce the loan amount, but I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the best strategy for the long term.

Please take the opportunity to do some investment with your money. I'm really shocked by some of my friends didn't do any investments. 

Majority of them save their money in saving accounts.

ASB, Tabung Haji are provided for you guys. In ASB, there's quite a number of investment types that you can choose it. I'm not asking you to take ASB loan. Just save inside the platform and every single year, you will get the dividends. Even if you're a Muslim and not confident with ASB, at least put the money in Tabung Haji.

You guys waste the opportunity or platform that has been given to you. Why save in saving accounts that give you none or a very very low amount of dividends. Now it's getting easier to withdraw money from one of the platforms.

l0fmos,MalaysianPF,1611044637.0,"Hey guys, I am a Malaysian virtual item trader. The items I trade are basically in game cosmetic items which make your character or weapons look cooler. Most of my trading activities nowadays involves cash, and 99% of that is done thorugh PayPal using USD. I do not have a MYR balance in my PayPal account only a USD balance.

Do I have to pay taxes in Malaysia on my USD balance in PayPal that I have not yet transfered through my local bank? Or do I only pay taxes on the funds that reach my local bank account?

I've been trading virtual items for over 5 years and in the beginning it was just a hobby but it slowly became an income source. I had no idea I had to pay taxes on whatever profit I generated there as I thought these were all technically worthless virtual items in a game and there's no way any of that is recognized in the real world. Also i've never had a job aside from this so I was not familiar with taxes when I started out.

About 3-4 years in I started realizing that I MIGHT have to pay taxes on my trades and became paranoid as I learned that I could face a 300% penalty on backdated unpaid taxes if I were to be audited. At the same time I realized it was almost impossible to figure out how much I made in profit or owe in taxes as I had not been keeping proper records of my transactions.

It was also complicated because there was a lot of cross currency trading which involved in game ""Currencies"" as well so it was hard to figure out how much I actually paid for an item and what it sold for eventually weeks/months/years later. These in game currency prices were fluctuating all the time and the USD/MYR prices also fluctuate all the time which adds another layer of difficulty in record keeping for a clueless person like me. There were hundreds or sometimes thousands of transactions per month which include microtransactions of a cent or less.

I feel kinda lost/paralyzed as I do not know how to proceed. I wanna start paying taxes, if I have to, but I have absolutely no clue how much I made in profits or how much I owe. On the other hand, I'm afraid if I open a file and start paying taxes now, i'm opening myself to an audit and late tax penalty payments. Also if I do open and estimate wrongly that's something else I could get punished for. It feels like no matter which option I take I am going to get intro big trouble.  Can anyone advice me on what to do? I feel like im trapped and can't escape getting burnt one way or another. Any help at all is greatly appreciated.

jth3me,MalaysianPF,1605279112.0,"Hi everyone. I'm currently being paid a decent salary (RM5k before taxes, EPF). I live alone, pay bills, rent, and PTPTN monthly so after all expenses (I eat cheap) I have about RM2k left to save. 

I don't have any assets currently. Savings RM10k and fixed deposit RM15k in total. Like many other young adults, I'm really keen to learn how to properly and efficiently invest my savings. 

FD rates now are pretty bad so I've stopped putting any into them.

11qv56z,MalaysianPF,1678763987.0,"Hi everyone,

I'm planning to buy a house with my wife in the next few years. We're planning to buy a condominium, and have been discussing how we should evaluate the value of a freehold vs leasehold property, especially if it is a mid-class condominium, not luxurious but have the usual facilities such as pool and gym.

I don't see the house as an investment vehicle, and I am not hoping to make money out of it if and when we sell it. However, we don't wish to lose too much money either.

Here's our thought: while leasehold is typically 99 years, condominiums would start to age and issues may appear in about 30 years, such as leaking, unmaintained facilities, broken lifts, etc. It seems like the condition of the property will not outlive the lease anyway.

Let's assume that we would be selling the house in after 35 years, how should we evaluate the pricing of the house now so that the value would be comparable between freehold and leasehold?

For example, given similar specifications, a leasehold condominium is sold at 500k, while a freehold condominium is sold at 600k. If I were to expect to sell the unit in about 35 years, which one would be a better choice, and is there a way to estimate it?

Thank you for your answers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/11qv56z/how_shall_i_evaluate_the_value_of_a_freehold_vs/,How shall I evaluate the value of a freehold vs leasehold condominium?,Property,30,23,1.0

""Generally, in Malaysia a company (Sdn Bhd) will need to perform the following in order to comply with the regulation under the SSM and tax authority:

Step 1. Preparation of account - This can be performed in-house or outsource to accounting firm/freelances

Step 2. Auditing of account - This statutory audit can only be performed qualified auditor

Step 3. Submission of tax return - This can be perform in-house or outsource to accounting firm/freelances

&#x200B;

In view that, your company has not prepare the first set of account since 20 Jan 2021 (incorporation date), there will be penalty for late submission of audited account. In addition, the first set of account should not be more than 18 months.

&#x200B;

In order to save the cost on preparation of account and penalty, I would suggest your company to have the financial year end as at 30 June. Thus, your company first set of account will start from 20 Jan 21 to 30 Jun 22 (exactly 18 months).

&#x200B;

Thereafter, you may prepare your second account for the period from 1 Jul 22 to 30 Jun 23 once the financial year close in this yr 30 June 23.""

My cgpa is not bad (imo) and maybe there is a chance for me to graduate with first class degree or somewhere near there, but exemption is not a choice for me as my mom's income alone put our household in t20.

I used to think like this too back then, but I realized it's actually just me not acquiring the knowledge to do it. It's not an easy game to play unlike Buy and Hold.  The hardest thing was that it‚Äôs hard to connect the dots and know what to learn at first.
To be profitable trading, we need to learn step by step on these:  
**1) Technical analysis (Analyzing the market)**  
\- Just read books (learn about candlesticks, trend, price structure, support resistance, indicators and risk management.)  
\- These gives you the knowledge on the current market condition to make decision.  
**2) Choose your lifestyle and risk preference**   
(Are you having a day job and can't look at the charts all day? or you're free enough to monitor the market all day. As for risk preference, what's the maximum risk you can handle before going emotional and give up.)  


**3) A systematic approach**  
\- IMO, a systematic approach is the key to be profitable, you must have a methodology that can be repeated and it's sustainable for your lifestyle and risk preference for ease of mind.  
Plan these:  
Entry, Exits, Position size, Stop Loss and What's the logic behind this trade.   
\- How to have a plan or method? Learn from books or someone who have proven themselves to be profitable. Don't figure it out urself as it'll cost you money experimenting with real money.(personal preference).  
For example, books like ""Trend Following by Michael W.Covel""

**4) Backtest**  
\-this means looking back into the history and find out if your methodology or systematic approach worked in the long run (10 years minimum).  
\- if it worked, it would probably work too in the future since human psychology and market's supply and demand principle stays the same.  
\- Backtest it using tradingview's bar replay, or write a script to backtest or read people's book and research paper.  


**5) Paper trade**  
\- Do not enter with your real money especially when you're starting. You'll regret it a lot. Because you are not sure what to expect yet. Give yourself a few months to a year to test the water.  


Lastly, if trading is not for you, consider investing diligently and work on the main stuff that generates you income. All the best in reaching out financial independence journey. Cheers!

I am working full time and taking a part-time degree at the same time. Recently I am looking to buy a property for own stay with my soon fiance at the price-tag of RM440k, monthly installment would be RM1800 including maintenance. However, my dad is still owing a total of RM99k of our own house of loan, monthly installment is RM680. My dad is currently 55 years old and he only want to work until he is 60-year-old. The current housing instalment is supported by my dad and I am trying to settle my dad's housing loan first before I buy my own property.  


For the given circumstances, what's the more appropriate to way on this situation?  
1. Continue to invest on my own investment fund and make full settlement after 5 years?  
2. Allocate my savings and monthly investment which is RM900 to help reduce my dad's housing loan?

11bkduh,MalaysianPF,1677329740.0,"Hi everyone, before jumping into it, here's some context. I'm a single Chinese guy that's close to 30. I've got no debts, really just driving an old hand-me-down car, renting in KL. I'm currently working in one of the top consulting firms for my specialty.

I'm currently deciding between these 2 roles:

a. Banking - one of the largest banking groups doing strategy. I'll be reporting to a very nice lady that embraces work life balance. This was originally my pick as I wanted to leave consulting as I am burning out pretty bad, and my team's technical skills not rising fast as I'd like - I want to do the technical stuff with a competent team, but the field is relatively new so people are still finding their grounds. In this case, the bank will be more stable, and there is huge movement in relation to what I'm doing - so there's going to be a lot of stuff to learn. I also like the feeling of having a HoD so I can bounce ideas off her - a very seasoned banker. I also intend to fund my own Masters/do more education-driven stuff if I go down this pathway. But I may get bored of it. Also, it could be a bit early to join banking. Salary is close to 14k, but one-off sign-on bonus is given.

b. Consulting - boutique firm in UAE. I've always wanted to leave the country, and this is my ticket. I was trying it for fun at first but I guess I got lucky. My only fear is similar to that of my current company - whereby the people there may or may not keep up with the stuff that I hope to do - I'm afraid I don't have enough technicals to weather the storm. Worse case scenario, everyone relies on me again, but the Partner there sounded very sincere and he said he'd also be willing to do the work himself to learn. Having said that, consulting is very team-driven, so as long as the team is passionate/driven enough I believe we can do it. Expecting massive growth in the region because of regulatory pushes. Salary is 20k, accommodation covered, fixed daily per diem at around RM200/day.

In the near-term, I think I'd love to work outside of Malaysia first, then (maybe) returning after a few years at least. So the issue is if I want to return (again, uncertain), I might as well stay here for something more stable and slowly but steadily grow?

Hi sifus! I (24M) am looking for some advice in regards to my my current financial situation. For some background, my gross is 7k (pending increase) from my 9-5 and around 3k from my side business. Currently only commitment is Rm 800 for a car. Rent is free and food as well (company) unless decide to eat dinner. 

During the last year (2022), I decided to try and apply for many different credit cards as they had many promotions and I wanted to try the experience different banks has to offer. And to my surprise nearly all cards got  approved so I started using them. As of right now, I‚Äôm planning to cut them down into just cashback and point cards. 

Unfortunately one thing led to another and now I have around 36k outstanding total. On top of that, I had to take out a personal loan for around 38k (7%) for 5 years due to personal reasons during last year. 

Recently, an ‚Äúadvisory firm‚Äù consulted me, did CCRIS check and recommended me debt consolidation for 100k for 10 years to clear off all my debts and the repayment is Rm 1092/month. 

I‚Äôm quite keen on taking this just so all the interest would not compound further and am confident this loan would not cause a strenuous relationship with money. Maybe just tighter cash flow and need to be meticulous with expenditure moving forward. I am also allocation Rm 2k/month and sinking fund for a new business.

sww3py,MalaysianPF,1645343810.0,"Hello,

This is just a simple analysis to consider whether should people rent or buy. Apologies if this has been covered previously. 
Caveat emptor: This is purely a simple financial analysis which may change depending on assumptions used or even non financial assumptions that may override this analysis. This is my view but people may come out to a different analysis. 

Assume:
Property price: 500k (e.g 2BR at South Link, jalan kerinchi 3)
Mortgage rate: 4%
Tenure: 30 years
Downpayment:10%
Exclude: legal, stamping (for simplicity reasons)

1) purchase outright using loan
Downpayment outflow: 50,000
Monthly mortgage rate: 2,148 (assume 2,150)
Total gross (or undiscounted) outflow: 824,000
At the end of the mortgage, you have your own property, which may have capital appreciation

2) rent
Initial cost: 2 months rent which may be refundable (assume no outflow)
Rent cost: 2,100 per month (possible to get around bangsar south for 2BR)
Total gross outflow: 756,000

Observations:
This may sound controversial, but at a price point of 500k, it makes sense to actually buy since the cost saving is only 68,000 (gross 68k, unless you can grow that 68k to cover 800k). However, at price points above 500k, it makes sense to rent considering that you can get plenty of properties to rent around 2-2.5k, but the mortgage for properties above 500k may just not be reasonable. I‚Äôve heard of companies factoring in future capital appreciation in pricing these type of properties. Will do another analysis if i have the time.

I currently have RM20K in ASB2, around RM2.5K in personal stocks and RM6K in Stashaway. The fund in Stashaway is for emergencies. 

On monthly basis,  I spend RM200 for food,  RM200 for fuel, another RM200 for leisure and RM547 for ASB1 loan. The loan is for RM120K, in its second year. 

Fortunately I dont have any subscription expenses,  and I used my parents' old car.  I am staying at hostel,  by which the fee is covered by parents. Car-related maintenance is also paid by parents, so my monthly spending normally stays within RM1200.

I save around RM4K-5K on ASB2, depending on how much I make that particular month. The rest goes to stashaway and my travel funds, equally. 

Is it wise to save most of my income on ASB2? I have been thinking to invest somewhere else, but am not sure where and how. My freelancing gig is very demanding, so I prefer passive investing which isnt time consuming. But I also prefer investment that can generate higher return than ASB.

om5o3x,MalaysianPF,1626533366.0,"Some background informations. 

I'm 32 years old, although I'd been working since 2009, I didn't start saving money until Oct 2019 (Use all my extra salaries to buy camera, pay for sister college fees, splurge on lifestyle beyond my financial capability). 



Things only started changing after I failed in my new property agent job and experienced extreme poverty where I had to borrow monies from people to sustain myself because I have no sale, hence, no income. 



I quitted the job and went back to my previous profession (video editor) and started saving. Salaries offered was RM3.5K, I worked my ass off for the first year and got RM1K increment this year, along with 2 months bonus (all goes into saving). 



So far, after almost 2 years of saving, my current assets are as following: 



- Saving - RM20,818
- Stashaway - RM3,700+
- Crypto Investment - RM5,000+ (Approx) 
- EPF - RM76,223



Every month I put in RM1,700 (about 45% of my net income) into my saving + Stashaway. Any extra income along the way will be put into my Crpto investment and hodlr until a year probably. 


By the end of the year I will have a total of **RM38,000** (Crypto included)



RM18K will be my emergency fund (6 months of RM3K) and RM15K will be use to build my dream battlestation (High spec PC with furnitures and peripherals) that would allows me to starts taking in freelance video editing job to increase my income. I currently can't do so because I have no PC to use. The balance RM5K will probably goes into new house renting deposit + some furnitures and appliances...



Aside from that, I am currently is renting in a low cost flat with my GF and her brother, rent is RM750/3=RM250 each. 



However, my GF and I planned to move to a better neighborhood in PJ next year. Rent will go up to RM1,000 for each of us. 

This is the first time I have this much saving in my life and I feel kinda guilty to splurge that much on my dream battlestation but that's something that I really wanted ever since I started working but couldn't afford. Moving to a better neighborhood is necessary too, for my GF's mental health (personal issue that I doesn't wanna discuss here). If it's not a good idea to move now, I would like to know how much salary should I aim to work for before I can comfortably afford such rent? 



But at least with a PC, I can potentially increase my income to at least probably offset the RM1K rental every month. I was never good with financial decisions so I would like to ask if this is a good choice from all the sifu here. Thank you for your time.


Edit: Additional Infos

- My relationship with my GF is stable, we have been together for 14 years

- We aren't planning to get marry for our whole life

- I don't have a car nor do I plan to get one, that's why we need to rent in area with connected LRT/MRT hence the high rental

- Even after I started renting in the new condo, I will still be able to save RM1.3K which is more than 30% of my income

Never in my whole life I thought I can get more than RM5,000 but potential upside is probably nonexistent other than yearly increment of roughly 2-3% as this is support role. The way up is becoming manager, which something I do not think I can do and I preferably not to do as well because I do not want to manage people and worrying about running the department.

**What I have/owe**

**EPF** = 44,767 (I opt for iSinar and this is the balance after I draw the RM10,000. Only 1x RM1,000 payment left). By my calculation at the end of the year I will have total RM57,000 in EPF account.

**Property 1** = I think balance is around RM64,000. I am paying RM360 per month now. I am getting RM1,030 rental now. I am renting out per room now, but the cost is higher because I am also covering TNB which average RM50 per month as well as installing Maxis Fibre in the premise which average RM95 per month also maintenance at RM50 per month). I think this property worth RM110,000.

**Property 2** = I think balance around RM138,000. I am paying RM650 per month. This is rented out per house at RM750, and I am paying maintenance RM70 per month. I think this property worth RM150,000.

**Savings** = RM0. Yes, I do not have any savings. Usually, by 3rd week of the month I am going to run out of money. Usually, it causes by things like overspending on groceries or little treats for my kids when picking them up after school/from nanny. I will stick to my budget strictly from June onward.

My gross salary is RM6,000 and take-home pay probably around RM5,120 (this is my first month). I have 2 rental properties which give me RM1,780 per month so in total around RM6,900 per month.

**Rough monthly expenses**

Rental = 1,100

Utilities = 200

Postpaid = 150

Kids expenses = 1,500

Groceries + househould items = 500

Takaful = 70 (coverage of RM350K)

AKPK = 240

Wife‚Äôs loan = 600

Property 1 = 720

Property 2 = 560

My expenses = 200ish

So roughly RM5900. I will start to save RM1,000 per month. Once my wife starts to work, I will ask her to take some load off me, so that I can up my saving to 20% of my gross, so at RM1,200 per month. She is expected to start in early June but now we are in lockdown so not sure when she will really start. I paid the bulk of our expenses; I don‚Äôt really mind because only recently I pay more. Been years since my wife the main earner and there was a period where I was not working as well.

**My rough plan in the future.**

**Emergency saving**

I would like to have 3 months‚Äô worth of emergency saving. At the rate of RM1,000 or RM1,200 per month. I should be able to hit this by end 2022.

**Unexpected expenses**

I will be allocating around 3K per year for unexpected spending or 1 time spending. Like in this year renewing car/motorcycle insurance and getting ready for my son primary school and my daughter entry into kindergarten. Those kinds of expenses.

**Property 1**

I am aiming to start paying off principal at the end of 2022 for roughly RM5k per year from EPF acc 2. My rough calculation indicate I should be able to pay off the property in 2030. I will try to rent per room if I can but eventually will opt for rent out the whole house. Probably can only get RM450 per month.

**Property 2**

I am aiming to paying off principal once I finish paying off property 1. Will use extra money from the money allocated for monthly installment as well. So, about RM4-5k per year. Then from EPF account 2 of RM5k per year. Will start paying circa 2031 and probably able to settle it off in 2038.

**EPF**

As account 2 will be used to paying off principal of my properties loan, and calculating from RM6,000 gross without any increment at all until 55 years old (Year 2042), and simply averaging 5% return per year, my EPF account 1 should be around RM570K.

**Own house**

If you guys notice, I am currently renting. I cannot afford 30% down payment and, in any case, I am under AKPK at the moment. I think I should be able to pay off AKPK in 2023/2024 but still years before I can afford the down payment. I would love to be able to buy unit in the same apartment I am renting as I intend to see out my kids finish schooling without having to move somewhere else. The average price for the apartment I am renting is around 320k. So, when I decide to buy, rental probably around RM1,500 and there will be maintenance of roughly RM150 as well. About RM500 increase from what I am paying now.

**Kids**

I am roughly allocating 500 per kids now and probably in the next few years as well. Honestly, this just take care only the basic needs every month. Like paying for nanny, pampers, milk, if need to get 1,2 clothes etc. I do not have extra allocated for their insurance nor their education. My wife was paying private medical card for my 1st and 2nd child previously at RM3xx. I have asked her to stop paying as my wife currently not working. Now with 3rd child this will push to RM500. Education is also important. My way of thinking is just going to government school, then public university. It will be nice if I can afford to pay until their tertiary education otherwise PTPTN is the solution.

**Takaful**

I am looking to add additional coverage worth RM500,000 around RM80-100 per month. It is cheap because this is the plan where you will have to pay more depending on your age. The online takaful plan. There are also plan where the premium will not increase but I have asked around and 300,000 is almost RM150. Which is a bit too much for me now. The takaful protection is coverage total of RM800,00 for the minimum of next 5 years as this is something I can immediately left for my family in the event I passed away or TPD.

**Retirement**

My target income in retirement is 40-50K per year. So, I should have 1M, 1.25M if want to live off the dividend/interest at 4% per annum return. But I have 2 properties which can bring in around RM1,200 per month, RM14,000 per year. Ideally would love to have that 1Mil and then these 2 properties rental. But the minimum is these 2 properties at RM14,000 and then RM700,000 @ 4% @ RM28,000 per annum.

**Suggestion/advice please**

Now this is the main reason why I decided to post here. I would like to get some input from you guys. What I can do more to arrive at a better future. I think in the next 1-3 years this is my plan that I will try to commit and make adjustment as necessary towards the end. Probably that time already clear my AKPK and save 3-6 months of emergency savings.

Any kind of suggestion/advice is appreciated. There may be things that I do not know about and will give me more options. Some may be not relevant to my situation, but I will welcome all with open mind.

&#x200B;

Since you have balance of RM30k in principal debt, and you do not have RM30k in cash laying around, can you work out with the bank to extend the loan duration, and at the same time lower the installment? You do not want to pay the normal installment since you are trying to free some of that allocation for other purpose.

The idea of selling the house is to get out of the installment commitment, but seeing you still have RM30k to pay for, you still have to pay the installment which is kind of defeat the purpose.

* Current Age of 30
* Household expanse / month of RM 5000
* 2% Inflation rate year on year
* Life expectancy : 100 years

The crude calculation does not take into account future investment and returns if any, and solely based on a singular target and hypothesis, "" If u want to achieve retirement TODAY, what is the value needed "", sometimes I find this method more concrete and has a clear goal to work towards to.  


The calculation is roughly like this

Of course, once you hit certain milestone, say by 1 million mark, you can start investing in assets that could give you passive returns, however, with any investments come risks, but at least you have a clearer goal what is your end game, before starting your investment

Some background of my lousy self; 28M, single and still ~~leeching~~living with family in Klang Valley area, IT sector job, nett salary RM6k. Monthly spending is relatively low for now;

- Eduloan: RM100
- Phone bill: RM30
- Petrol: Roughly RM150
- Parking fees: RM10-RM20
- LRT fare: <RM20
- Food: <RM200

since I'm still kinda in hybrid work, only once or twice a week commute to the office, hence the fairly low spending on the commute, but soon management will probably order all to come to the office daily which could cost me roughly more or less RM500-RM600 per month (fuel, LRT, parking, food) in the future.

No other loans/commitments. Deposited like RM500 per month to Wahed roboinvest on US stock portfolio, RM500 on crypto, the rest just sitting in my regular bank account. Occasionally also bank in a little to my Tabung Haji account just to keep the account active (account my parent made for me since childhood, don't even wanna go Hajj)

Not really looking to get married or building a family anytime soon, I don't really want kids... My considerable financial plan in the near future is just to register an ASNB account and just throw like half of my leftover savings in there.

uqnot6,MalaysianPF,1652675626.0,"Originally posted to r/malaysia's daily random discussion. 

Financial advice needed.

Okay. I'll lay out all my debts first: 
2 credit cards (one almost 4k and the other about RM250);
Car loan (paying 984 monthly);
PTPTN (supposed to pay 301 monthly but I'm going to cancel the auto debit - will explain why below);
AEON credit loan (about 10k - paying almost 300 monthly).

I get about RM3,355 after deductions.
1. I withdrew about 14k from EPF last month thinking of using 9-10k to pay off PT and to use the remaining 4-5k to pay off aforementioned credit card debt. As it turned out, they sent the lump sum to PT directly despite me cancelling the withdrawal the very next day I confirmed it. I went to the office on a Thursday to confirm with thumb print and something the officer said kept nagging me and made me call EPF again only to find out that the money won't be sent to my banking account (did a withdrawal last year and it was sent to my account so I assumed it'll be the same). Went back on Friday to cancel and was told on Tuesday that the payment had already been processed and can't be undone (fak PT, seriously). I called PT to see if I can withdraw a sum and was denied. So now, I'm 14k poorer in my EPF account and debts round my hip.
2. The AEON credit loan? It wasn't an emergency or anything. I feel like a fool to have taken the loan. I was scammed. Think Tinder Swindler except this is a China man and I put my money into an app that's supposedly under Citibank. Shortly after I sent the sum, the app was removed from my phone and no matter how hard I tried, I couldbt find any info on the app or redownload it using the apk link. Its broken. Anyway. I'm paying for my stupidity but at least, I made sure to take like a 6 year plan so that I don't end up paying more than I can afford monthly. 
3. The credit card application is also tied to the same situation although the money spent is wholly on me and the spender in me. I'm very boros (not proud of it, JS). I shouldn't have taken the CC. That's all I've got to say. 

I'm struggling to pay for everything on top of car expenses and just other needs. I really need some advice as to how I can solve this. I have a part time job and give tuition classes and get about a few hundred from those two jobs but even then, I find that I have the tendency to spend beyond my limit. I stop only when I've got less than 200 in the bank and it's really bad. I need to stop myself.

My main expenses are:

* Food (I almost exclusively eat out)
* Petrol (Approx RM 150 / month)
* Generic online shopping (I don't buy much but my GF does use quite a lot of shopee)

I was thinking of these cards:

* Generic spending - Maybank 2 cards
* Food - Maybank Grab and/or same as generic spending
* Online shopping - Maybank Shopee
* Petrol - Not sure if I need a petrol card as I don't refuel that much. but I am a big user of Petronas so maybe a card that can utilize Setel

Suggestions for other cashback cards? I am mostly concerned with cashback (don't really see the worth of points)

Is this overkill? Having potentially 4-5 cards. Most of my choices don't have an annual fee so that's ok for me. 

Is it worth it to sign up for cards just for the free gift offered?

I am just thinking that I am not as unfortunate as him as I will most likely be working forever until I am at a retirement age, while the son is definitely going to inherit the business and become a boss.

jrfi12,MalaysianPF,1604987601.0,"Hi,

My current main salary is \~10k(MYR) & \~5k (USD) from side income monthly. Monthly expenses are roughly 4k. Current liquidated savings are 100k (\~8% risk) on SA, 10k on MBB savers acc, 10k on two tiny startups as capital, some shares with friend's parents companies (I don't know how to manage these, please advise!), I kept my side income untouched on Transferwise & Paypal to serve as emergency funds for now.

I need advice on

* How to optimize the generated foreign currencies for investments instead of exchanging it into my MY account. Can I just use SA? Are there any other recommended way/app to invest that I can just deposit via Paypal/ TransferWise?
* Recommendation on more ways for FD, I have checked FD rates for local banks, it seems like they have promos, does the rate changes after the promo ends? Pros and cons for monthly & yearly? What is the ideal situation(?) for both?
* I'm unsure if I should get a broker (recommendation if any!) to help manage my investment stuff or DIY because I'm very occupied with work, and I've been wanting to go to uni after almost 5 years of endless workload, so I would like to be able to live on investment (small amount as allowances) for a short while during uni time instead of savings.
* I have a small budget to learn investing as I'm more of a hands-on person, would like some recommendations on apps, books, sites, youtube channels, etc for dummies like me. :' )
* Insurance linked-investment plan?

Current major obligations are car loan, rental and personal insurance. I have been tracking my finances for the past 4 months now. Safe to say I am able to save roughly 1.5k a month and been sitting in my savings account doing nothing. Future plan is to buy a house in the next 5 years.

I am bumi and based on my reading, no brainer option is to max ASB. I dont even have one but in order to max out, might need to apply ASB loan but the recent dividend payout doesnt make sense to me to opt for ASB loan. Since I want to buy a house in future, ASB loan will definitely affect my DSR. Other option for passive income that I am tempted is to try Stashaway.

As the title suggest, I'm thinking about graduating from my 18y'o hand me down E46 325i.

Don't get me wrong I absolutely love the car, it drives well, looks good and sounds amazing too, but its been giving me quite a lot of issues lately even though I take very good care of it (timely oil change, replace the thing that needs to be replaced on time).

I'm 23M and currently working as an entry level IT and getting paid RM3k with no debts / commitments other than utility bills (no PTPTN / CC / Rental).

The main reason I've been sticking with this car for so long is because it was my dream-car, and I don't need to pay the bank monthly. 

But since I'm currently working in a place that requires me to drive 40km everyday to work and back, I'm starting to question if my current car is a good choice. The road to my workplace is littered with potholes (thank you MBJB) and heavy trucks too. I don't want to end up stranded in the middle of butt-fudge nowhere if my car decided to yeet itself just to spite me.

I can of course fix those underlying issues, but the problem is since its already a very old car, would more things go wrong that require even more money to fix? Would it still be worth it? Or should I just trade the thing in for an affordable new car that I can drive hassle free for at least 5 years?

As mentioned in the title, I'm 30, single male, an only child with absolutely no intention of having a family, and am responsible for 1 parent who is in their mid 50s. I have 150k in savings and 40k in EPF (started working VERY late, around 28 when I finished further studies). My gross salary is 5k/mth, after EPF, tax, etc and monthly expenses including rent, I end up with more or less 2k a month in savings? I have no debts whatsoever OR credit score (have fear of credit cards as family and relatives accrued a shitload of debt because of CCs). As a result, I am extremely frugal with spending and currently renting a unit for 1k/mth in a somewhat dodgy neighborhood in PJ. I have been thinking of buying a condo unit for my mum and I to live in, but I'm not sure how much I can actually afford (I know living conditions are subjective, so I am considering newer condos with clean and safe spaces for her to take afternoon walks) or if I can even get a loan without any credit score (not to mention a guarantor, which I believe banks would require for any large loan). I have done some of my own research but I'm really lacking in unbiased ""pass-down"" financial advice from family or friends.

zjv4ce,MalaysianPF,1670841022.0,"I usually buy second hand cars. I know there can be a big debate about buying used Vs new, but so far I've preferred buying used and that works for me.

Now my usual approach is to buy a 5-6 year old car and then use until the cost of repair over a year, to keep it running well, exceeds 30% of the car's value.

Which usually means I can keep the car for about 10-15 years from the time I buy it. Again, many factors that would affect this such as quality of the car, floods, accident etc but this is the general idea. That I use until it doesn't make sense to keep using.

However, I recently started wondering if it makes more sense to sell and buy another 5-6 year old car every 5 years.

I tried to do some calculations:
6-7 year old car. Buy for 20k

Use for 10 years, sell for 5k
Cost of ownership of the car per year: RM15k/10 years = 1500/year

Use for 5 years, sell for 10k
Cost of ownership of the car per year: RM10k/5 years = 2000/year

(current market value of second hand cars are very inflated due to supply chain issues, so I'm just taking an average for cars I've seen in the past. Again, the brand and how the car is kept will affect resale value, but for just a general discussion I've taken value of car depreciates by 50% every 5 years as a benchmark. If you have a better benchmark, please let me know).

Pros and cons

Pros
Buying every 5 years helps us have cars that keep more up to date with latest tech, safety, advancement in cars

Cons
- Have to spend time more often to look, research, purchase a car (every 5 years Vs 10 years)

- Every time you buy a second hand car, you are taking a gamble. If you are wise and hard working, you will research, ask around and do thorough checking before buying, to minimise risk as much as possible. but if you worked really hard to find a good car, you might prefer to keep it as long as you can rather than every 5 years try to find another good second hand car, especially if you maintain your cars very well.

- Based on my calculations, it's cheaper to keep the car rather as long as possible.


So my conclusion is, that it's better to buy and keep as long as possible. Again, I'm not talking about personal preference. Some people love cars and want to change more often. That's a personal preference decision. I'm talking in regards to being financially prudent as well as reasonable.

I‚Äôm a 20M, just finished my Pre-U, I took IBDP as preparation to go overseas, and I‚Äôll be pursuing my undergraduate studies in 3+ months. I live in KV, specifically the area of Dengkil

Since IB is just like A-level/Foundation, I don‚Äôt have any domain knowledge to work in a specific industry/sector like those with diploma do.

So my question is, what‚Äôs the best paying jobs for someone like me? If I work at grocers/convenience store (Village Grocer/ Mercearia Grocer/ 7E/ 99/ MyNews), how much pay should I expect? Is it the latest minimum wage of RM 1,500? And what‚Äôs the process of application like? (Sorry this is literally my first time job hunting üòì)

And would they even take someone/offer contract that can only work for 3 months? 

Other option I thought of is sales, specifically the clothings/ fashion (like Padini/ H&M/ Uniqlo), for those line of work how much pay and workload should I expect? (Same applies to my first option) 

But I‚Äôm unsure of the second choice because the nearest mall or outlets for those brands are 25+ minutes away from my house, and based on google maps, it‚Äôs gonna take 1-2 hrs if I rely on public transport (which is kinda my option since I don‚Äôt own a car and e-hailing prices has skyrocketed lately ü•≤). So I do not know how feasible it is. 

And my last choice is remote work as ghostwriter/ copy writer. I am pretty confident in my writing skills, especially for English, I scored an 8.0 in my IELTS and taking IBDP means I have solid foundation when it comes to academic writing. But I have no idea where to begin with job searching for this type of job. Any tips or guide is appreciated, also what‚Äôs the range of pay and how does it work? Is it on commission basis? 

Sorry if my question is too long and if I am oversharing, any reply, general advice or point towards the right direction is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance üôè

Additional note: 
Thanks for those replying and suggested me to take on internships but as I have mentioned before, I really lack in any domain knowledge and experience in any field to do any internship because IBDP is simply like STPM where we study mix of subjects (physics, math, chem) so even though I am going to continue my study in CS, sadly I have no experience in coding so interning is out of the question for me üòÖ. Another thing is that I am looking for jobs just for the money, and jobs that doesn‚Äôt demand much experience (retail work/minimum wage etc). That‚Äôs why I asked the pay for workers in grocer/fashion retail. Any suggestions like F&B is also welcomed. I hope anyone with knowledge regarding the pay/process of applying can share it with me.

I plan to eat more vegetables and lesser meat when ordering ‚Äòeconomy rice‚Äô lol.

And what kind of food can I easily cook? By ‚Äòeasily‚Äô, I mean to cook in shorter time. I do know how to cook (but still beginner level).

Carrots?? They can be easily steamed. Broccoli??

sgntnt,MalaysianPF,1643590207.0,"My family has a 13 year old perodua Alza and a 14 year old Proton Saga BLM. At this age I'm starting to consider replacing one or the other (preference for one larger size for 2 kids plus stuff which is how we currently use the Alza). Cars aren't giving any serious issues yet, some repairs along the way. Just due to them getting older, am concerned whether they will both need replacing at the same time which would be a financial stretch.

Does it make sense to replace one right now? As I tend to drive longer distances (35km one way for work) and for safety reasons not really considering the Axia. 2nd hand myvi as well seems a bit non ideal, and new Myvi price is practically the limit of my budget.

Regarding the tax resident thing, am I a tax resident? I have never payed any tax in my life. Am I required to be a tax resident? If not, is there any benefits to being one? I have a rakuten trade account and I wrote I'm not a tax resident would that affect anything?

This info is not to be used in court. Info and procedure can vary by state, my experience was in Selangor. Consult your own financial advisor, legal advisor or local Islamic offices for your own situations. I welcome any corrections from anyone more well versed in these matters.  


You are welcome to share this info, but please link back to this post.  


This is the final part of my series on financial estate management. The previous articles (linked at the end) were mainly for muslims, but this one has info for everyone.  


The purpose of this article is to know the (LONG) process of closing down the bank accounts of a deceased person, and provide info on how we can pre-plan to make the process easier for our loved ones to handle our affairs when we pass on.  


If the deceased had a wasiat/will or hibah (gift upon death), the executor will handle the financial affairs, but you will need to provide as much financial info as you can from any paperwork and files. They will get the latest bank statements, pay off debts, transfer any vehicle or land/house deeds, and distribute the money. This process will take approx 6mo to a year, depending on how complicated the estate is. The executor will take a percentage as stated in the wasiat/will terms. (See previous articles for more info.)  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If no wasiat or will, and for items nor covered by hibah, one person will be selected from the waris or heirs to be the administrator. Taking the example of a deceased parent. Preferably the administrator will be the deceased person's spouse or adult child. This person needs to be able to travel and be available to visit each the HOME BRANCH (branch where the account was setup - unless updated after moving) of each bank in person, several times each bank. Exceptions are ASNB can go to the nearest ASNB office (not bank agent for ASNB), and Sijil Simpanan Premium can go to any BSN. For muslims, the administrator must distribute the money by faraid/wasiat/court decree, whichever is applicable.  


After collecting the death cert, the first step is to collect all the financial info. If you are lucky, the deceased will have left a detailed list of banks and accounts. If you are very lucky, you might have all the internet banking login info. You need to know the amounts in each bank / account. Without the internet banking logins, you will need to contact each bank to get a statement of accounts and find out the bank deceased withdrawal policy. You may be able to do this at the nearest bank branch, or have to go to the home branch, depending on each bank policy.  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If an account has a penama or beneficiary named, the account can be withdrawn with just the death cert by the beneficiary. Please note that for muslims, the penama is not entitled to the entire account, they are actually the trustee to distribute the amount by the terms of the wasiat, by faraid, or by court decree, whichever is applicable. Examples of this are EPF/KWSP, Tabung Haji, and insurance.  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For non-beneficiary accounts of small amounts (under 5k/10k per account/bank, depending on each different bank limit), you should be able to withdraw the money without a Letter of Administration.  


HOWEVER.... there are many hoops to jump through, and each bank will have a different procedure. You will have to go to each bank HOME BRANCH to start the process and get the paperwork, and again to later withdraw the funds. (And maybe one more time in between for additional signatures if needed.)  


You may have to do some/all of the following: certified copies of each waris/heir's IC, signatures of all waris in front of commissioner of oaths, witnessing of signatures in front of a Pegawai Kerajaan Gred A/Lawyer, LHDN stamping, a letter of verification from the bank of the account to which the money will be deposited to, etc. Plus bank paperwork and bringing documents like death cert, sijil faraid,¬† IC, birth cert etc. For closing my late mothers SSP, BSN even required my deceased father's death cert. There are costs to getting notarised signatures and certifying documents. So if there are many waris and not much money in the account, a lot might be used up in these costs. Also, the process will be prolonged and complicated if there are many waris living far away or even overseas, or have difficulty to travel due to age or disability.  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For large amounts (over 5k/10k/depending on bank), the bank will require a Letter of Administration. This will be issued by the High Court (total estate value over 2m) /Land Office (estate under 2m and has house/land) / Amanah Raya (no house/land, for muslims), depending on the total value of the deceased's estate.¬† This process/values may vary by state, so check your own state procedure.  


The process to obtain this Letter of Administration can take a long time. Depending on how complicated the estate is, how complicated the waris/heir situation is, how long it takes for you to get a hearing, how many hearings are needed... it can be 8mo to several years.  


But once you have the Letter Of Administration, the withdrawal process can be completed solely by the administrator. The paperwork is much easier compared to above. (Except for ASNB. They still want LHDN stamped form and notarised signature. And they will only transfer the money to an asnb acct in your name.) You alone will fill in forms, create a deceased account to deposit all the money from various banks into, collect cheques from each bank, deposit them to the deceased account, wait for the cheques to clear and then distribute the money to all waris/heirs from that account. Thus, you will still probably have to visit each bank HOME BRANCH at least twice for each bank.

TIP: if there are some accounts with small amounts and some with large amounts, and you are not in a hurry to withdraw them, include the small accounts in the list for the Letter of Administration. This way you can use the Letter of Administration to simplify the withdrawal process of the small accounts.

  


SPECIAL NOTE: ELECTRONIC FIXED DEPOSITS  
These can be tricky. There is no bankbook/paperwork (unless you find printouts), so you might not know of them until or if you contact the bank. And the process to close them down is especially complicated. I had to deal with 2 banks for this. One bank could do it, but it required Main Office approval, which took over a week. Another bank declared they couldn't redeem them, but fortunately I had the online logins, so with a change of phone number to give me the TAC codes, I was able to withdraw the E-FDs.  


  


Withdrawal of investments and stocks not under banks will be another matter, which I have no experience in. You will need to contact each service provider for their deceased procedure.  



Of course, debts such as loans and bills must be paid before distribution of the remainder to the heirs.


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So. How can you make the process easier when you will probably be the administrator for your parents estates? It is a sensitive matter to talk to our parents about death and¬† finances. And you cant really tell other ppl what to do with their money or property. If they are open, try having them go through the tips below.¬† But considering you will need to make several trips to each bank, I would say the number 1 thing to do is to ask your parents to make sure all bank home branches¬† are updated to your closest location, especially if the account was set up in another state. Its a good thing to do after moving house anyway. If you ever need a new atm card, you may have to pick it up at the home branch.  


Apart from that, having a updated list of banks and accounts and insurance and investments helps a lot, if you can persuade your parents to make it. Also, encourage them to file away financial documents and also all documents like birth certs, marriage cert, family death certs, property deeds etc.  


&#x200B;

For further detail on managing our own financial affairs, for muslims please read my previous posts linked below. But in general, these are my suggestions:  


1. Keep the bulk of your savings in an account with penama/beneficiary, so that it can be accessed without delay. Also, for muslims, I strongly recommend you to hibah or wasiat these main accounts and also your insurance to be given fully to your spouse, because if by faraid it may be divided between all the waris and a widow may only be left with a tiny fraction. (See my previous articles.) If the bulk of your savings are in ASNB, it is not available to put penama, but you can hibah that to your spouse.  


2. Simplify your accounts. Close down any that you rarely use. Update the home branch every time you move.  


3. Keep a running list of accounts, investments and insurance. Keep it updated. Make sure your spouse/heirs know where to find this info, along with family documents.  


4. If you do find yourself in a position where the end is imminent (old age, critical illness) do your best to wrap up as much of your estate as possible, as fairly as possible to your heirs. Sell off or transfer property deeds for properties you are not actively using yourself. Withdraw funds from hard-to-withdraw-from sources like asnb,¬† investment accounts and the stock market, and keep it in an acct with a named beneficiary.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**PART 3: Strategising your own financial estate**

I will be honest. Dealing with the death of a parent without a financial plan is a long and emotional process, in an uncomplicated circumstance. For someone in less fortunate circumstances, for example a young widow with small kids who depended on the husband‚Äôs income, who may be fighting other waris, whose own portion of the estate is miniscule and whose small kids‚Äô portions of the funds are now in limbo and will later be administered by a company far away, the process would seem insurmountable and be emotionally devastating.

Knowledge is power. Plan the best future for your money and your family. Give your family the gift of a secure financial future.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

These are my tips:

&#x200B;

**1. Keep it simple.** Keep your affairs simple, i.e. try to keep money in only a few strategic places. Empty out (and keep the bank book showing 0 balance) or close down any accounts that are never or rarely used. This will relieve a lot of headaches as the person dealing with your estate will have to go to each bank in person to find out the amount in each account, and again later to come back with the Surat Kuasa to withdraw the funds. Some banks even require the executor to go to the home branch (the branch where the account was opened).

Also, if you have a joint account with your spouse, check with you bank on whether the account will be frozen if one of the accountholders passes away. This varies by bank. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2. Documentation and lists.** Keep a running list of accounts/properties/investments. Keep this list updated regularly, and also update penama/hibah recipients/wasiat terms immediately if/when necessary.

Get an accordion folder and keep this list, bank books, family documents like death certs, birth certs and surat nikah, property and vehicle grants, insurance documents, S&P agreements, wasiat or hibah info, and any other documents that may be pertinent. Make sure your spouse/adult kids know where this folder is kept and how important it is. I call it my Fire Folder ‚Äì in case of house fire, this is the only non-living thing I would try to save.

u/Tieraslin had the fantastic suggestion to digitize everything and save it to the cloud. While you WILL need the originals of family documents for filings, digitizing them is a great way to have all the info on hand if needed by any member of the family at any moment, and also is motivation to start compiling and safely organizing everything. Save them in a passwoed protected google document folder.

Also, I know this is a difficult topic, and I know older people do not like to speak of death, but try, very diplomatically, to get your elderly relatives to keep a financial list and gather financial/property/vehicle/family documents. Maybe you could use the excuse of digitization for family history records. You will thank me later.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**3. Prepare immediately accessible funds for your spouse.** Husbands: please realize that by faraid your wife will only get a TINY fraction of your estate. It may take over a year for the funds to be processed and released. Funds that are allocated for your underaged children will be controlled by a corporation far away. You NEED to plan for the future of your family, especially if you are the sole breadwinner. 

THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SON. Your siblings/other relatives will be entitled to big portions of the estate (Faraid calculator:¬†[http://faraid.usm.my/msl/faraid.asp](http://faraid.usm.my/msl/faraid.asp)). On your death, there may be vultures circling looking for whatever they can grab. Relatives who will righteously claim their ‚Äúhak‚Äù while ignoring their responsibility to look after the grieving widow and small kids. Sounds like a drama melayu, but it is too real. I even recently heard of a man who was severely injured, in a vegetative state but NOT YET DEAD, who had SMALL KIDS INCLUDING A SON, whose brothers ambushed the stressed-out wife and took the family vehicles as their ‚Äúhak‚Äù.

Apart from the below, if you have a joint account, check with your bank whether in case of your death the account will be frozen or not. Make arrangements for property to be kept at least jointly in her name.

Here are several easy options to provide immediately accessible funds:

&#x200B;

**3a. Insurance.**  For a young family starting out, life insurance for the breadwinner is a must, so that in the event of sudden untimely death, the future of the family is provided for. You can hibah the insurance to your spouse by Hibah Takaful. Without hibah, even though the wife may be the nominee, the money will have to be distributed by faraid or wasiat. Check with your takaful agent for more info.

Also, consider medical insurance for the entire family. Nothing will wipe out savings faster than a serious illness or accident. On a tangential note, invest in living a healthy lifestyle and also regular medical checkups for all. It is much cheaper to prevent or catch any conditions in the early stage than at a Stage 4 diagnosis.

&#x200B;

**3b. ASB.** Most malay muslims will stash their savings in ASB accounts, as this has high dividends. You can hibah the ASB account. There is a fee to set it up and a percentage administration fee upon payout. [https://www.asnb.com.my/hibahamanah.php](https://www.asnb.com.my/hibahamanah.php) Without hibah, large amounts will need a surat kuasa to be withdrawn and then distributed by wasiat/faraid.

&#x200B;

**3c. Tabung Haji.** While last year‚Äôs dividends seemed depressing at 1.5%, this actually isn‚Äôt too bad considering TH auto pays 2.5% zakat on funds deposited, so indirectly the dividend was 3.5%, comparable to a FD. \[You are obligated to pay yearly zakat simpanan of 2.5% on the minimum total within one year of all funds in other accounts yourself.\] TH dividends are normally much better, usually in the 5% range. You can nominate a penama, who will be able to withdraw the funds immediately upon death but will have to distribute it by wasiat/faraid, and there is a risk that a wasiat may be contested.  Or, you can hibah your TH account to give it solely to your spouse. There is a fee to set up the hibah and a percentage administration fee upon payout. [https://www.tabunghaji.gov.my/en/savings/services/hibah-amanah-th](https://www.tabunghaji.gov.my/en/savings/services/hibah-amanah-th)

Also, a benefit of TH savings is that the money can easily be transferred online to a maybank account, or withdrawn via several linked ATM networks, compared to FD which is stuck till maturity.

(Additional tip: open TH accounts for your kids as soon as possible and gift them the minimum needed and register them for haji. The haji queue is so long that if you wait for them to do it for themselves, they may only get their turn at age 100. Plus, many parents neglect to pay zakat on their kids‚Äô savings. TH will pay zakat automatically.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**4. Wasiat.** Hibah is by far the most secure option, but not all assets can be covered by hibah.

For example, you cannot hibah a EPF/KWSP account, but you can give the content by wasiat, either solely to one person or a distribution of your choosing. Any property still under loan cannot be given by hibah, but can be given by wasiat (subject to the loan being paid off from the liquid assets first). A deceased person‚Äôs portion of a jointly owned property cannot be given by hibah, but can be given by wasiat. A vehicle still under loan cannot be given by hibah, but can be given by wasiat (subject to the loan being paid off from the liquid assets first). \[You could hibah a fully paid off vehicle, but there is a high chance that you may sell the vehicle and replace it, which would invalidate that hibah.\] Any asset to be given by hibah must be specific, but assets to be given by wasiat can be stated in general terms.

HOWEVER ‚Äì a wasiat requires the agreement of ALL the legal waris, as determined in the Sijil Faraid. If any of the waris contest the wasiat, estate distribution reverts back to faraid.

Thus, if you have an uncomplicated waris situation and are confident that they will not contest the conditions (bearing in mind that the prospect of easy money can turn people), you might consider a wasiat. Here are some tips to optimize your wasiat :

&#x200B;

**4a. Think about how it is written to cover all eventualities and minimize amendments.**

For example, if you intend to give all your properties and vehicles to your spouse, it may not be wise to name specific properties or vehicles, as if you over time sell them and do not update the wasiat, you will later need to prove the property or vehicle is sold and no longer in your possession. And some people do not keep sale documents for very long. Thus, be general, for example you may state ‚Äúany properties owned‚Äù or ‚Äúany vehicles owned‚Äù.

However, if you want to give different properties to different people, then you do have to be specific and also update the wasiat regularly when you make changes. Each time you amend your wasiat you will be charged a fee and have to meet the wasiat body to put your signature to the changes.

Consider how future changes might affect distribution and try to write that in. For example, you might want to state that any assets assigned to a waris who passes away will be distributed equally to the remaining waris. Or if you decide to gift money to grandchildren, use the general statement ‚Äúall my grandchildren‚Äù instead of naming each grandchild by name, or else you will need to update the document each time a grandchild is born, and any grandchildren born after the last amendment will be left out.

Discuss this thoroughly with your wasiat consultant before finalising the document.

&#x200B;

**4b. Know that money distributed by the wasiat administrator is subject to percentage fees, but money mentioned in the wasiat but claimed and distributed by a penama is not.** So, if you keep the bulk of your funds in EPF/KWSP, Tabung Haji and insurance you can state the distribution of money from these accounts and the penama can immediately withdraw and distribute it according to the terms of the wasiat, without being charged wasiat distribution fees. Of course, if the penama has also passed away, the administrator will handle the withdrawal and distribution and charge the percentage administration fees.

&#x200B;

**4c. Be sure to regularly review and update your wasiat.** For example, if your parents pass away you will remove them as beneficiaries. If you sell a property you may need to change the asset distribution to keep things balanced. Or if you wish to gift money to new family members or a friend or a cause close to your heart. You can amend your wasiat, for a charge each time of course.

&#x200B;

**4d. Use the wasiat to state your wishes regarding your underage children and administration of their portions of funds.** If a husband passes away without any wasiat, the default administrator of the minor childrens' portions of the liquid assets is not the wife - it is Amanah Raya. If you have a wasiat, the default administrator of the childrens' portions of liquid inheritances is the wasiat administrator. You can state in the wasiat that you wish your spouse to be the financial administrator of your childrens‚Äô portions of your estate and the funds to be used for their care and needs. You can state that in the event that you and your spouse both pass away, who you would like to have custody of your kids and (if you trust that person implicitly) to make that person the financial administrator of the childrens' money, to be used for their care and needs until 18yo. (The default is husband‚Äôs father.) This may have to be approved by the judge, but it at least gets your wishes on record.

I'm admittedly very new to crypto, and I don't even know how to properly buy on Luno exchange. I tried to purchase a limit of RM50 but it said I was below volume. What does that mean? Hence I ended up buying using the simple method albeit with a 2% charge.

Can anyone help illuminate the basic workings of crypto exchanges? I tried watching YouTube videos but it's not very detailed on the Luno exchange functions. Also confusing are the limit, market and stop limit functions on Luno and now I'm wondering if Binance is even more complex haha.

11q0yfm,MalaysianPF,1678684687.0,"I want to purchase a laptop that cost around 3600-4200 (for work and light gaming). So I'm wondering should I save my money for a few months and buy it with cash or should I just use my credit card and buy it with installment plans at 0% interest over the course of 12 months (300-350/mth) ?

For extra context: Im a junior dev with monthly salary of RM3000 (net RM2649). I have no debt / commitments and I still live with my parents. The only thing I have to pay is my own food (RM600), insurance(RM235), gas(RM300), phone bills (RM50), subscriptions(RM100), household needs(RM200) & margin \~RM200. This left me with about \~RM800 to save each month. My credit card limit is RM6000 and it is my first CC (Maybank Islamic Ikhwan Gold).

This is my first job (8 mths in) and I have no savings currently (just a few hundred in the bank). I use my previous salary for living expenses, settle debts and personal purchases (2000 phone, 2000 nintendo switch, 1000 car repair, 200 nephews present, 800 some house accesories like vacuum, shelf, etc). 

As for the laptop, the reason why I want to buy a new one is because my current laptop is \~5 years old and is already showing signs of aging ( slow boot, lag, internal fan no longer working which causes it to overheat, old components like ddr3 ram and sata ssd 256).

Since I'm a dev, obviously I need it for work but I would like to purchase one with a decent GPU as well so that it could run some games smoothly. I only play dota2, csgo, rocket league @ 1080p so I dont need any fancy screens / gpu / cpu.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/11q0yfm/cc_installment_vs_cash/,CC Installment vs Cash,General questions,21,45,0.87

So today the car I've been using since I was 18 broke down and the shop recommend I sell it as there is a ton to repair and I agree that it is time to move on. I actually wanted to create this post a month ago because I felt like my car was slowly dying but delayed sampai hari ini (which is going to end  up costing me a lot in repairs). Now, I need a car, and I am looking for advice on something that is good, reliable, and most-importantly, financially sound. The details of my situation are as below:  


Age: Early-Mid 20s  
Location: KL, need to drive for work  
Income: Varies slightly but roughly RM12,000 a month   
Commitments:   
\- RM3000/mth savings + investments  
\- RM4000++/mth to support family (parents semi-retired, brother studying)  
\- RM500/mth holiday fund.   
\- Total: \~RM8000/mth non-negotiable commitments (excl saving for future house and upcoming car payments)  
Downpayment: Mostly my current car value (\~RM10,000++) + a bit of rainy day money which I will rebuild over the next 2-3 months. Total: RM15,000

May I know what cars you recommend for my situation? I'm not too familiar with the local car economy so I could really use some guidance. I'm not super fixated on looks or appearance, but I don't mind going for a slightly higher budget car than say a bezza or axia. Also prefer non-hatchbacks, if that matters.  


I was thinking a 2nd hand honda city (2010+ model), but really not sure what is considered a good 'bang for buck' car, or if certain cars are much better due to reliability/less maintenance costs. Any advice is appreciated! Also open to any questions/clarifications

‚ÄúTrue to its name, the fund will heavily focus on global public equities with an asset allocation of up to 99 per cent as it adopts a strategy of investing in high quality international companies with strong growth prospects and companies that will benefit from global megatrends,‚Äù PNB said in a statement today.

PNB group chairman Tun Arifin Zakaria said the introduction of ASN Equity Global marks another major milestone for PNB and ASNB as the fund management companies continue to fulfil their mandate to all Malaysians by providing easy access to global markets at an affordable entry point.

‚ÄúOur comprehensive range of unit trust products now cuts across multiple geographies and fund categories, comprising conservative, balanced, and growth funds, allowing our unit holders to fulfil their financial and investment goals,‚Äù he said.

ASN Equity Global is managed by PNB‚Äôs team of professional fund managers based in Kuala Lumpur as well as its London office, to capture and capitalise on opportunities in more than 50 major global stock markets.

The minimum initial investment is only RM10.00 and additional investment from as low as RM1.00.

Starting from September 1, 2021, investors can subscribe to ASN Equity Global at the initial offer price of RM1.00 per unit until September 21, 2021 on all channels, including¬†www.myasnb.com.my¬†and myASNB mobile app, ASNB branches and agents nationwide, as well as ASNB agents‚Äô internet banking facilities.

Between September 1 and December 31, 2021, ASNB is offering a lower sales charge rate for all over-the-counter subscriptions. ‚Äî Bernama

ot74xb,MalaysianPF,1627467817.0,"This is something I did while I was bored at night while I couldn't sleep so I decided to go look up all this information as a comment reply to some random guy who probably hasn't even read it lol. Copy pasted most of it with slight edits.  Most people on here keep recommending local Unit Trust Funds without actually naming any unless you PM them (wow, I wonder why) while personally, I'm invested in US-based ETFs (namely VOO, QQQ, IVW) so I decided to compare them based on available information online and their Fund factsheets. 

First comparison is between a ""Good"" Local Unit Trust managed by a reputable company and one of the S&P 500 ETFs; VOO. It doesn't really matter which one of the latter you use since their returns are almost identical and there's a hundredth of a % difference in fees.

10 year Returns:

|Fund|Annualized Returns|Total Returns|Annual Fees|Entry Fee|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Kenanga Growth Fund|10.34%|267.50%|1.54%|Up to 5.5% NAV|
|Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO)|14.80%|297.61%|0.03%|0|

* NAV - Net Asset Value (i.e. total value of the fund per unit)

Oh but there's better ones you might say. Ok, most solid return with lowest risk ETF like VOO or SPY is not good enough for younger people who want to yolo all in for the best returns. Let's grab some random growth ETFs in the US market like Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) that targets the best sector - technology specifically versus the Absolute Best‚Ñ¢ performing unit trust on the local market targeting the best that China has to offer. Let's throw in another random US growth ETF as well, VUG for comparison.

10 year Returns:

|Fund|Annualized Returns|Total Returns|Annual Fees|Entry Fee|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AmChina A-Shares - MYR|17.86%|417.30%|1.8% / 0.20%\*|Up to 5.0% NAV|
|Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)|21.25%|586.61%|0.20%|0|
|Vanguard Growth (VUG)|17.47%|400.41%|0.04%|0|

* \* Not sure why it's stated as 0.20% when the annual management fee is 1.80%, might be something that I'm not understanding from the official sources. 

As you can see, the passive US ETFs consistently beat any actively managed local unit trusts/mutual funds. In the long term you're losing double digits % returns just by using vastly more expensive options. But it all depends on your risk appetite and professional preference of course.

An additional point, we're not subjected to US Capital Gains Tax but we are subjected to the 30% withholding tax on dividends, which the broker will automatically *potong* on your behalf. You can reduce it by investing in Irish-domiciled ETFs but there's not a lot of those since they don't bother with complying with the regulations of a relatively tiny market like the EU so they're not allowed to be traded there. 

We are subjected to US Inheritance Tax (first $60k is exempted) so make sure you transfer the cash back before you croak in case you want to give it to the next generation. Otherwise, just forget about it lah. Personally, I'd swap over to local or SG FDs/Bonds/REITs for passive income to escape the volatility of the stock market once I reach retirement age.

or6wl4,MalaysianPF,1627196615.0,"A little bit of background story. I just started my first job on mid april this year with a basic pay of RM2500. Currently staying with my parents.

Net pay is around RM2200 after epf, socso etc.

What I‚Äôm planning is as follows :
Savings - RM1000
Parents - RM200
Car - RM450
Phone bill - RM50
Food - RM300 (this might be less than half because wfh)
Entertainment - RM100
Balance - RM100

As I‚Äôm staying with my parents now, i dont have any rent expenses. For food, currently my company is wfh and might probably open next week but with schedule so i will probably still working from home like half of the week hence the food cost might be less than 300. Also the food cost is actually an estimate calculation with 10 ringgit for 30 days. The car is a halfway paid car and it is not the full pay of the monthly cost as my father wants to help me pay. I dont really need a car actually but my father insisted as i will be paying that amount for only 3 years and the car will be mine. Entertainment consisted of paying Netflix subscription, spotify, and others. This is also merely an estimation. Netflix plus spotify is just rm20 though. The balance of entertainment expenses and my balance after deduction is what im gonna use to go out with friends etc. 

I‚Äôm planning to put all my savings of 1000 into asb but i dont mind taking out 20%-30% to invest somewhere else. 

I need some advices on how or where to invest the savings, and how to manage my income in general. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/or6wl4/need_advice_on_how_to_properly_manage_my_income/,Need advice on how to properly manage my income [23M],General questions,21,27,0.9

n62vdz,MalaysianPF,1620291257.0,"I recently discovered that I couldn't login to the Remitano cryptocurrency exchange website from Malaysia. I‚Äôve been using Remitano smoothly for a very long time. So, this is quite a panic situation. After searching for solutions around Google. I noticed that Remitano has been blocked in Malaysia for some reasons, but that's not as important as how to login back to the exchange to make sure my digital assets remain unchanged.

This issue persisted for a while until I figured out how to work around it. If you're having similar problems, here's what worked for me, and I'm confident it will work for anyone looking to avoid the potential Remitano block. Luckily, all of my assets remain safe and I can still trade as usual.

There are 2 options:

**1. Use Alternative Domains for Remitano**

https://preview.redd.it/yx8uohdsrgx61.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ced70209d3c46e784880df8c8113d672b512422c

Another option is to use one of Remitano's alternative domain addresses to get around the block. The following are alternative domain names for the Remitano website.

 [https://remitano.network/](https://remitano.network/) 

If none of these alternative domain addresses are reachable, you can use their [proxy hub address](https://remitano.github.io/) to get the most up-to-date information on account access.

Keep in mind that all three alternative links are official; thus, carry out the same operations as you would on the main Remitano site. Don't worry about the security or the authenticity of these alternative domains as Remitano provides them.

**2.** **Use VPN**

The first step toward gaining access to the site is to contact a reputable VPN service provider. One excellent example is the [**SurfShark VPN**](https://surfshark.com/), which I have personally used. Of course, you are free to try other VPN services, but this is what I used:

To connect to the SurfShark VPN, follow these 3 simple steps:

**Step 1:** Download and install the SurfShark VPN software onto your device. Although I am using a PC, this VPN software is also available for iOS and Android:

https://preview.redd.it/dgezbpmurgx61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d7a6b6ab16d149310216391a6a234f64e0691bcc

**Step 2:** Use SurfShark to connect to the internet from one of the available locations. For instance, I've changed my nationality to Singapore. Then I'll wait for the VPN to load my option.

https://preview.redd.it/qywiswsvrgx61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4edb66567be89dea3ea11c3961d25952605e084b

**Step 3:** The final step is to log in to the Remitano website and access your account.

https://preview.redd.it/9p5pu5azrgx61.png?width=1323&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=203376edc87c538543e992d0f982e1d36a7bd682

All of your assets will be safe and secure, and access will be available as long as your VPN for a different location is turned on.

The reason is I saw the potential of compounded dividend and wanted to diversify my investment. My plan is to invest RM200 every month per account till I retire, aka about 30 years from now. My goal is to treat it like an EPF but with other accounts as well and with the ability to withdraw them for emergencies even before retirement. I already have EPF and ASNB by the way. So my sister suggested Unit Trust.

My quick search in this sub tells me that unit trust is predatory and fixed deposit is the better choice.

1. Go bust/bankrupt (due to unstable government/politics/policies) and we lost our money (maybe not all, but some)

While senior engineers can earn at least RM 8,000 are quite impressive, I'm not sure if I want that kind of responsibility. I'm not sure if I can handle that amount of pressure either. 

It probably comes off as no surprise, but we engineers tend to get overworked and underpaid. What's worse is that we aren't entitled to OT (and probably annual bonus as well). 

Low salary among engineers has been a prevalent issue for a long, long time. BEM and IEM has been kept awfully quiet and trying to sweep the problem under the rug regarding this matter. I see no action has been done from either of them.

2nd is Futu's Moomoo - Tencent has a stake.

Both of these apps are licensed by Monetary Authority of Singapore. Both of them offer USD 2 broker fee for most USD trades. Both of them are dead easy for Malaysians to open account.

After using Tiger for a few months, I signed up for Moomoo for their free AAPL share promo (hint: I got it, I sold it to buy VXUS).

Here are how Moomoo is doing much much better than Tiger:

1. The app is much more stable and pleasant to use, translations are well done, you won't get half chinese half english texts like in Tiger app.

2. Deposit is near instant. For Tiger, you need to deposit to their bank account, write your code in reference, send in bank slip, wait 5 minutes for approval. But for Moomoo, you deposit into a DBS account made just for you!! There is no need to write unique reference number, and no need to inform them. They detect deposits in 1 minute everytime I tried!

I am a 24 year old who has been working since late 2019 (1 year+), and have accumulated a considerable amount of savings. This was the result of working on multiple freelance projects over the past year after work for most week days, and thanks to flexible working hours. However, I realize that this is not the path I want to go down as the work:pay ratio is too underwhelming, causing me to feel quite burnt out as of late. I earned an average of RM6k/month the last year. My current net income is RM3.8k/month

I am almost completely invested, with barely any cash at hand (an excuse to prevent myself from lifestyle creep and spending whatever is in my savings). I started investing right after the market crash last March. To simplify things, I will be listing it as such:

    Type [ Initial capital, current valuation ]

My initial and current weightage consists of:

>Cryptocurrency \[ 30k , 72k \]

I think I got pretty lucky with ETH's bull run as last year was when this all really took flight, and thus, my current valuation seems to be quite overweight. Based on my initial capital, cryptocurrency consisted of \~60% of my holdings, and is now at \~85%.

>Roboadvisors \[ 9k , 9.3k \]

I use StashAway at 36% risk index.

>Public Mutual Online \[ 2k, 2k \]

Recently opened an account with Public Mutual to target specific markets which I find to have potential, and plan on rebalancing my portfolio eventually.

Now that this information is laid out, I would like to ask a few questions on how I should go about my goals, which was initially to save a 100k by the end of 2021 (current valuation is \~83k excluding EPF). Currently, I am saving about RM1500 a month (no longer taking up freelance work to focus on my own mental health). However, with the current bull run on my cryptocurrency holdings, I believe this is realistically achievable at the end of the year.

My questions are:

* What is a realistic goal to achieve by the time I reach 30, given that I have a net worth of 100k (excluding EPF) at the end of this year, when I am 25?  

* I am not sure whether I should liquidate a chunk of my cryptocurrency holdings, as it is currently overweight compared to the rest of my investments. However, I don't feel like it's a good idea to withdraw it in favour of lower returns in safer investments. Currently, my holdings are parked in a Celsius wallet generating interest and also staked on Kraken for rewards.  

* If you think I should not liquidate my crypto holdings, should I just DCA from the money I save monthly (RM1500) into crypto, StashAway and Public Mutual respectively (RM500 each)?

My finances are a mess and I need help. Here's the breakdown..

I'm still working and earn about 9k nett

I am blacklisted on CTOS due to a credit card (about 5k), a personal loan of 60k (outstanding arrears about 10k) and also a motorbike loan with Aeon (about 9k)

I have not been paying any of the above for some time now. Reason being..

I took up a loan with a credit company (high interest rate) and paying every month now about 6k (which leaves me about 3k to use per month). I have even lost count at how much I exactly owe to the company, but I'm thinking north of 30k. So this is the main thorn of my finances which also disables me from paying the above loans and card to get me off CTOS, as I still have normal life commitments (rent, car, food etc)

I would appreciate anyone's help on my situation and how best to go about. I've been thinking to look for a loan to cover all my oweings above, and just concentrate on paying that every month. With my 9k salary, I can easily commit about 2k per month for repayments.

That really made me want to get a good grip of my finances and I also have the time to do research now, while job hunting. 

**The situation**

* I feel that I have been quite a diligent saver. Current liquid, invest-able assets is about RM 320K++. EPF also has roughly the same amount. 

* Manageable debt (1x car) and manageable dependent (mother) 

**Advise needed**

* I'd like to invest the current assets that I have...which is mostly in cash =/ I've already set aside an emergency cash fund in case of extended period of joblessness. What should I invest in? Robo advisors? Reits? Blue chips? I wanna set it and leave it. 

* Once I get a job, I hope to then use what I'd normally save to invest. Should I stick to the set-it-and-leave-it, or am I in a good position to take on more risk? 

* My partner doesn't save much and dislikes reading - I'd like him to learn more as well about PF. If you all have recommendations for localized podcasts on personal finance, please let me know!

10ksy3w,MalaysianPF,1674631227.0,"I've been looking to buy a car for about 6-8 months now. My current car (2007 Saga) still runs well but... It vibrates really really badly when stopped/idle. I've been to many mechanics, they've tried different things (change engine mounting, increase timing) but it's still bad. On top of that, it's manual. It's never been an issue before but I moved to Sungai Besi last year and well... It's excruciating to be stuck in a one hour jam almost daily.

My budget was RM12-13k for a car (cash). But the second hand car market is terrible right now. Cars are going for 50%-100% more than 1-2 years ago. All the cars I'm seeing at the RM12k range currently... I feel might as well keep my current car (which I have taken excellent care of).

Either they have lots of repairs needed or they vibrate/not smooth when driving.

Recently, a few family members who have heard me talk about my search for a car suggested why not I just buy a new saga automatic. It's RM38k, monthly is about RM425, so with interest comes up to RM44k.

However, for me, a car is to get from point A to point B. As long as it's safe, reliable and reasonably comfortable, that's all I need. It's also a depreciating asset, so I usually prefer to spend less on it.

When it comes to car price, I usually follow a (take home salary X 6 months) approach for how much to spend on a car. Based on that, I can currently spend RM25k on a car (which would still be a second hand car).

But second hand cars usually have a higher interest rate on loans and also, need to put some aside for potential repairs.

So at this point, an alternative I've come up with is to just start looking at cars at the RM16-17k range. Hopefully, I'll find something more suitable.

I'd like to know if anyone has any feedback on my thought process (is it wise/practical?), suggestions or advice. Thanks!

Edit:
I'm mostly looking at a Proton Saga 2012-2015, Automatic. I've had friends recommend 15-18 year old Myvs/Vios but... While they are generally very long lasting cars, I'm still a little hesitant to get such an old car. I hope to keep this car for at least 5 years.

I previously was considering a Hyundai i10. 2 years ago (according to friends) a 10 year old one would sell for RM7k. Now it's selling for... RM16k. i10 repairs are expensive, I feel it's not worth while with the current price.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/10ksy3w/looking_for_feedback_on_buying_a_second_hand_car/,Looking for Feedback on Buying a Second Hand Car in Current Market Conditions,General questions,21,24,0.96
1090l3q,MalaysianPF,1673429178.0," Hi rich abangs, questions about EFD.

Lets say I've placed EFD 10k at BANK A, December 2022, rate of 3.5%, 12 months maturity date.

Then I found out January 2023 there's a special promotion from the same bank, 4.05% at 6 months maturity. 

So base on logic, January is best for a new placement. Time for maturity is way shorter & higher in return. 

Thing is, placement for EFD offered by the bank is only for new fresh funds (basically from other banks).

So question, if I withdraw now (before maturity) & transfer to BANK B then transfer it back to BANK A as new funds, will it work? Or will they know it's an old fund that was previously placed before?

* **Salary:** RM18500.00 (x13 months). Estimated (estimated as I haven't officially started the role yet) net after PCB/deductions: RM13000.00. Annual performance bonus max: RM21645 (usually received)
* **Major expenses:**
   * Home loan: RM2000/mth
   * ASB financing: RM1000/mth (\~RM900-ish)
   * Rent: RM2000/mth
   * No car - I still have my old one from uni days (second hand from parents)
* **Minor expenses:** Utilities, groceries, ""fun"" money, eating out etc: RM3000
* **Investments:**
   * Primarily ASNs: RM600,000 across 4 portfolios (RM200,000 is from the financing)
   * Gold: RM10000 (steadily adding a few thousands \[RM\] per month here and there).
   * I tired Wahed (RM1000) for the past 1 year on a Moderately Aggressive portfolio and it's fluctuating too much for me to look into it long-term
* **Final take home pay**: RM5000

Thinking of pulling back on the ASB financing to get a bit more purchasing power and/or move it to another investment tool. I like ASB, it's low risk and a pump-and-forget investment tool. Although open to other investment streams.

I would consider myself from a very financially unstable family with lots of debts (bank and not bank) due to various of reasons. I'm the youngest among the siblings and the only one pursuing for a Bachelor's Degree. 2nd sister is doing biasa2 with her own family whilst me, and 2 elder siblings are still partly depending on parents.

For that and among other financial situations I understood that I needed the financial support to alleviate my family's financial burden for my study. I got very lucky and got a scholarship from a private company with 3 years of bonding period after I graduate. Yet, after having practical training twice with the company during my semester breaks, I found out I'm not interested in the company and its industry. I thought I liked it but apparently not anymore. 

I'm torn apart either to break the scholarship agreement and pay back the money awarded to me OR I could just suck it up and work in the industry that I don't like for 3 years as per the agreement after I graduate. 

The problem is I still need the money to survive. For context, even I got the scholarship, I'm still working part time occasionally and try to be as financially independent as possible.

I don't drive nor do I plan to get a car so I prefer living near to my office but the area is kinda pricey. I earn RM5.7k(RM5k after EPF, etc.) and have found some apartments at about RM1.3k. I have read that you should keep rent below 25% of your salary. 

I also started work part-time this month which is bringing in an additional RM5k(total salary RM10.7k) so I figured why not get a better apartment at about RM2k. 

My main concern is that if I lose the part-time job, I would be spending 40% of my salary on rent. So would it be advisable to go with the pricier apartment at the gain of comfort(the cheaper apartment is not as well furnished as the more expensive one and it has less space as well)? I mostly sit in front of my computer all day for work so comfort is a priority for me.

Instead if you want to be a millionaire by 60 years old (and if you start working at 25 years old):

Initial deposit RM3,000

Yearly interest : 6%

Monthly deposits:

Age 25-30: RM250

Age 31-35: RM500

Age 35-40: RM750

Age 41-50: RM1,200

Age 51-60: RM1,500

I choose this to mirror (hopefully) a realistic increase in salary for the average urban Malaysian who works in a corporate company. If you take investing just 10% of your salary, based on my calculations above, it means a fresh grad take home salary of RM2,500 and a take home salary of RM15,000 by the time you are in your 50s.

&#x200B;

Edit 1:

For the salary range, I took a range based on 10% of the savings needed in my calculations. RM2,500 was based on articles I read ([https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2020/12/652686/survey-reveals-bright-job-prospects-fresh-graduates-2021-2022](https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2020/12/652686/survey-reveals-bright-job-prospects-fresh-graduates-2021-2022), [https://eduadvisor.my/articles/the-highest-fresh-graduate-salaries-in-malaysia-2019/](https://eduadvisor.my/articles/the-highest-fresh-graduate-salaries-in-malaysia-2019/))

RM15,000 was taken based on a rough estimate of 5% increase in salary year on year ([https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/malaysia-salaries-expected-to-rise-4-5-in-2021](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/malaysia-salaries-expected-to-rise-4-5-in-2021)). You can also refer here for the salary table ([https://www.easysurf.cc/samt8n3.htm?ansal=2500&ipcsal=5&time=35](https://www.easysurf.cc/samt8n3.htm?ansal=2500&ipcsal=5&time=35))

&#x200B;

I don't have the statistics on this but through at least my social circles, I've been told that reaching RM15,000 is quite possible if you work in corporate.

  
Also, if you worked from 25 to 60 in corporate, your EPF would also probably reach RM1million (or more). ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/mfr74o/becoming_a_millionaire_by_60/,Becoming a millionaire by 60,,20,21,0.95

A solid combination of good rewards/cashback with an extensive coverage to provide peace of mind and actual value. No more Buyer‚Äôs regret, no more paying extra for extended warranties. Now accepted by Shopee. 

Recommendation: Go for it. It's a credit card that provide protection and rewards with no worries about having to fill other type of categories to get your full rewards/cashbacks.

Now with Shopee, you get more choices and you don‚Äôt have to keep your receipts/statements, it is all inside your account, ready to be used whenever you need it.

I'm coping well about it- I saw it coming since March & mentally prepared myself to half-expect it. And I didn't really wanted to stay anyway as work was getting monotonous, unfulfilling, & toxic.

What I am truly worried is that I don't really have a plan. I don't know what to do, and I'm not sure what skills I have other than having worked as a flight attendant for 5 years. I also don't have a degree- I dropped out of my law degree before becoming a flight attendant.

Fortunately, I have saved up and invested a good deal of savings to last me at least a year. Of course, I wouldn't want to touch these as they will be my retirement savings.

I'm also driving Grab, which I did part-time even before Covid, so this does help a bit. But of course, business is slow.

I am certain that I at least want to have the income I had previously, with opportunity for growth. I was pulling in RM6k a month.

Naturally, this entails something commission or sales based. Many of my other colleagues who were retrenched are also doing sales jobs now, selling insurance, property, cars, etc.

My understanding is there is no capital gains tax or tax on [dividends for individuals at the moment](https://www.thesundaily.my/home/taxation-of-foreign-source-income-the-saga-continues-HH9494786) but that could change in the future. I'm 23 and am most likely at least 20-30+ years from withdrawing my investments so I'm assuming it's extra important to keep proper records from now to be prepared for if these taxation rules change by then but am not sure if there are any things I should be keeping records of that I'm not already.

I'm not day trading and my plan is to simply continually passively invest by paying in monthly or every two months into a combination of SWRD and EIMI ETF's which are both accumulating rather than distributing ETF's which are Ireland domiciled (for the lower witholding taxes).

I have set up an IBKR account which I am funding by transferring money to Wise from my bank account then transferring from Wise to my IBKR account. At the moment I'm keeping copies of:

* Individual online transfers to Wise
* Individual Wise tranfers to IBKR
* Quarterly bank statements

So my questions are:

1. Do I need to declare anything to LHDN now or only when I withdraw the funds in the future? No expereince dealing with LHDN so any advice would be appreciated.
2. Aside from the current records I'm keeping should I also keep some log of my transactions within IBKR and if so what info is most relevant? In IBKR there are loads of options for statements and custom statements under the [Performance and Reports tab](https://imgur.com/a/iZLDLjj), which ones should I be generating and keeping records of to be prepared for any potential changes?
3. Should I be trying to keep the records of dividends and capital gains spearated and if so how? Especially if with compound interest the dividends also would be having multiple years of capital gains.
4. Should I switch to a distributing option such as VWRA instead to make it easier to separate between capital gains and dividends? And if so any suggestions for distributing ireland domiciled alternatives to EIMI or WSML for exposure to developing markets?
5. How would it work if I worked abroad for some time and was continuing to fund my IBKR with my salary while abroad and then would be withdrawing in the far future in Malaysia? Any differences in the records I should be keeping then?

I‚Äôve signed the contract of employment fortnight ago without knowing the fact that I‚Äôve gotten accepted at one of the big 4 firm in Singapore under audit. I had my interview with the Big 4 SG firm 3 days ago and have been offered an audit associate position yesterday via email. They will send out the offer letter within 3 days. The commencement date for Big 4 SG is sometime mid September 2022.

After mulling over about which path to pursue, I‚Äôve decided that I want to start my full time career in SG. The role that I‚Äôll be assigned to at the British foreign bank will be Relationship Manager under Priority/Private Banking which isn‚Äôt the ideal choice for me.I believe being an auditor in SG would bring vast knowledge and I‚Äôll definitely learn more than being a relationship manager. 

Both pay are enticing. For the British foreign bank, I‚Äôll be earning RM5.5k whereas in the Big 4 SG, I‚Äôll be earning SGD3k. I‚Äôm aware of the high cost of living in SGD but I‚Äôll try my best to be as frugal as possible.

So guys, any advice on how to renege/rescind my current offer letter with the said bank?

I graduated exactly last year, will need to repay starting this month with a total loan of about RM20,000 (so about RM180/month). I expected to be granted the first-class honours exemption, but it turns out my income combined with my parents would put me just into T20 (checked the taxes as I wanted to appeal but... numbers were not on my side), so I've kind of sucked it up and accepted that.

There's a current promotion going on with until 31 April, with:

1. 10% on monthly direct debit repayment
2. 12% on half payment
3. 15% on full payment

I only have about RM12k+ cash savings from work the past year, so I won't have enough for a full payment settlement. I would've went for the 10% discount.. but it ends next month. So I'm currently in a dilemma on whether I should go for the half settlement with 12% discount or not.

By paying RM10k now, I'll get about RM1,200 off my remaining debt. This would also half my loan repayment time, probably saving abooout another RM1,000?

I guess I'm considering on whether I should pay this RM10k now, or if this RM10k would grow enough in investments to not matter. Though I haven't really started investing aside from a couple thousands in crypto and Stashaway, as I'm not familiar enough with stocks or other options now (I do plan on learning it soon though!)

I know RM10k isn't that much to some of you, but it's almost all of my emergency savings! Though it shouldn't be a problem as I have no heavy commitments, and I'm almost definitely able to save up this amount again this year.

For context, I checked the their salary range and it ranges from sgd3.5k to 4.9k. I don't wanna shoot myself in the foot by offering too low a range but I also don't want to put them off with a range more than what their budget is. What do you suggest? My thought is putting a range on the higher end, e.g. 4.3k-4.9k (negotiable), with the minimum number being what I am willing to settle on. Or is it better to just put ""negotiable"" and give my range after I pass all the interviews?

mbixce,MalaysianPF,1616517869.0,"Hi everyone!

So I've been doing some thinking and would love to share both what I've learnt as well as get some feedback.

I currently invest my money in a mutual fund. I've been thinking of improving my investments so I've been reading up.

Here is how I currently save:
30% of my income, broken down into 3 pots.

Retirement (money is to be never touched until I turn 60/65) - 10%
Long term (money is never touched except for big goals like buying a house) - 10%
Short term (for things like handphones, laptops, money for gifts for family, basically anything not under monthly expenditure) - 10%
20% - For my parents
50% - monthly expenditure

My current plan is to increase my income and to use at least RM100 a month to invest in stocks. My current budget is pretty tight and extra income wont be a lot for now, so taking the mantra (only invest what you can afford to lose), I'm ok with RM100 a month. I plan to invest in Malaysian companies first, just to get my feet wet. Thinking to invest in AirAsia.

I've recently opened up an M+ account. Very easy to set up, all done online.

For my 30% of savings, I plan to:
Short term 10% - MBSB Cash Rich Savings account
1.4% interest and can access the money anytime. Seems the most straightforward, as there is literally no requirements to get the 1.4%. OCBC Frank is higher at 1.65% but you have to transfer funds from one account to another and only can be done on their app.

Long term 10% - Will continue to be in the current mutual fund while I look for other places to invest

Retirement 10% - ASNB (non Bumi here but hoping to see if I can get some) or will top up EPF.

Now here's where I am hoping to get some feedback:
I've been reading online (https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0810/the-7-best-places-to-put-your-savings.aspx) and from what I understand, money that I consider my savings should always be put in more low risk investments.

1. What local investments would be considered low risk but at least 6%-8% returns? From what I understand so far, I'm looking at ETFs, REITS, gold, etc.
2. Any opinions on investing in Public Bank stock? They seem to be very very steady over the past 10 years (with the exception of 2020). I'm thinking of taking out my Public Mutual and just investing in them but again, it's not money I want to lose.
3. I'm considering either FSM, Wahed or Stashaway as another place to park my 10% long term. But don't know much about those 3 and so again, this is money I'm not willing to lose.
4. Any thoughts on the RM100 per month into AirAsia stock?

I've gotten some awesome knowledge from this community and really appreciate all of you. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/mbixce/savings_investment_and_risk_what_ive_learnt_so/,"Savings, Investment and Risk (What I've learnt so far and looking for feedback)",,19,21,0.89
m7kbgj,MalaysianPF,1616046917.0,"Hi all! I am wondering if there's a Malaysian index fund like US's NASDAQ index fund such as Fidelity's FNCMX where you can pretty much set it and forget it because you are investing long term?

I have read that actively managed funds rarely outperform the stock market over the long term, so I am iffy about picking and choosing individual Malaysian stock myself, or paying a fund manager to do so. (this may be a faulty assumption in Malaysian stock market, if so correct me)

Therefore, I am looking for a low cost, high growth index fund that I can just steadily contribute into without worrying about the daily ups and downs (30-40 years until I near retirement).

If such a thing doesn't exist in Malaysia, please tell me about how you invest into the stock market (foreign or domestic) as a Malaysian, I could use the inspiration. Thanks!

&#x200B;

Update:

Thanks for all your input! It appears that Malaysian ETF, especially the ones that track KLSE, are very bad when compared globally. It seems like my best bets (RM 100K to invest) are the following:

1. Stashaway at 36% risk index (17% Return in 2020) which is close to S&P 500 2020 return, but nothing close to NASDAQ 2020 Return. (***70%*** of my investment until I find better options)
2. [G0LDM4N\_S4CHS](https://www.reddit.com/user/G0LDM4N_S4CHS/) mentioned the combination of CIMB SG + Tiger Brokers to buy US low cost, high growth index fund, which would be the best option if Tiger Brokers turn out to be reliable. Will put around ***10%*** of my stock investment in their hands using this method to try it out.
3. Bitcoin via Luno (***20%*** of my investment), I am in my 20s and am fairly confident it will go to 6 digits valuation in the future (hopefully near future), in the mean time I could ride out the fluctuations.

I was thinking about individually picking and choosing Malaysian stocks but that seems too time consuming and not very promising.

I'm a 20 year old Bumi studying in medical school. Only joined this sub about a week ago, I think. Been interested in 'growing my money' for a while now. Tried to read all those financial books, but they focus more on the US/those parts of the world. So I would love to hear advice from you money-making machines.

Right now, I have zero experience in investing or doing anything good with my money. All I do is spend on short-term pleasures and cry when I look at my bank account. Currently, I only have Bank Islam account opened because it's required for JPA PIDN scholarship. The JPA financial aid gives me about RM5.5k per semester. On top of that, I also get \~RM300 from mamapapa monthly (not since balik rumah for lockdown though), and they pay for the college fees instead of me having to use the JPA money. Despite all of that juicy income, I currently only have RM3k in my bank account. I must be considered fakir miskin in this subreddit. Regardless, I still want to try and make something of the money that I have right now (, also in about 2 weeks JPA allowance coming in for new semester). One thing I think worth mentioning also is that I'll most likely only start working when I'm 24-25 during housemanship, so this is pretty much the only income I'll ever have for 3-4 years.

Some advice I've read and heard before I joined this subreddit include opening a FD account, opening Tabung Haji, buy/sell gold, but I've practically ignored everything because I'm so lazy to do anything plus got no time cuz in school.

Your advice is very much appreciated, thank you.

For context, I started working in 2020 and began my 'investing' journey through DCA-ing into StashAway  (April 2021 to May 2022) and 2 Public Mutual funds (April 21 to Feb 23)

Cumulatively I have around RM12.3k in StashAway account 1 (at -5% loss) and RM5k in StashAway account 2 (at -10% loss). On Public Mutual side, have invested RM6k across two funds (currently at -13% loss)

Moved to the UK for work in August 2022 and that's when I started taking my investing more seriously - doing proper research into the index funds and blue chip stocks that I invest into. On average, I now invest around 950 pounds every month. When I started investing into StashAway and PM, I had no idea what I was doing and just follow parents advice to go with PM funds and just blindly follow the consultant's recommendation, at least now I know what I'm getting myself into and everything is a calculated risk that I am happy to accept the outcome given that I did it through an informed decision based on the information I had at that point of time.

I am not in urgent need of the money but have run out of ringgit which I still need for monthly installments from previous purchases which I have been transferring from pounds to ringgit every few months.

Given all that I have mentioned, for all my positions in StashAway and PM, should I just sell them away and call it a day? Or should I just hold until I break even and then sell away? Or at least on the StashAway side, should I start to DCA again in an attempt to get it back to breaking even faster and face the risk of FX? Curious to hear your thoughts!

So the story is, I just finished my internship as video editor & videographer (5 month) in a small company, and I been through probation (8 month total), I think I just waste 3 month in the company that give me probation salary around RM1k without any SOCSO and other things that I dont know (KWSP?).

Basically the timeline is :
Intern : 15May - 30September
Prohibition :  1October - 30December

The problem is :
the company doesn't offer me any letter when the transition between intern and probation. Meanwhile, before the probation end, they doesn't offer me any letter to continue working there. If I do working there, I have waste my time because the salary is not include the SOCSO or any other insurance. What i mean not include is the company doesn't cut any amount of my money to put in the saving things like socso.

1 month before I learn the truth (company give offer letter 1 week-month before official), I tried to ask them about the offer letter, any rules or any benefit working there or anything i can auto invest like kwsp, the answer they give me is nothing, i mean nothing is they told me that i dont improve and i need extended my probation. So, as someone in a creative department, the things that i need to improve is creativity, as for myself, U did a great job helping others co-workers, create content and production, its totally hard to working in creative industry because the salary is not based on knowledge and skills but based on something else. and also as my mother said that, if probation salary is RM1k, mybe my full salary will be 1.5k. then I realised that IF the company cut my salary because of socso or else, it will be 1.2 ish, wth was that.

I dont think i can stay in that company longer so in the middle of the month I try to search for a job, then I get an offer letter from MyStep, the thing is, that Mystep Program will end on same month (December). So, I show to my company about that, then I tell them that I get the offer letter but the program will end same month. Then, they ask me if I want to accept it or not, then I said that if I accept, it will end this month. So, fast forward 1 week before the year end, they tell me that my last day is Friday 30th December, yup, last week, I even didn't give them any resign letter, but they decide to end my job.

My current event is :
make license
wait for MUET test

Art Teacher
Content Creator

So for people who are experiences.
My question is :
am i waste my time there?

So my work sucks. I get only paid 1.5k a month for a diploma level job. My position is a junior graphic designer but for some reason I am also a laundry maintenance staff, take notes of our sports item stock, and also the ""muscles"" of the store. I get projects thrown at me nearly every single day, every hour. And my seniors and boss kept pushing me like hell to manage all of these stuff while also designing artwork for banners and trophies. I am honestly confused what my role is at the store. Because I somehow need to manage more than just art designs. If it's just talk to customers and collect payment and maybe even delivery items, I'd be fine with it. I've worked at AEON and McDonalds before and I have never been confused while working there because my job role was clear. Here, idk what exactly my role is and which I should prioritize. When I'm doing my artwork for a client ""Hey, can you check our size 4 competition football stock. Also put all the items in this list in a box so we can deliver it to them"" and when I did that, ""Hey can you check behind gas tank behind the laundry store? Take a picture of the meter"". Ok and when I go do that ""Hey! Why haven't you finished your artwork for the client yet?"". This is my first step into the graphic design industry and this will be a big mark on my future resume. But the responsibilities I've been given just doesn't feel right with my job spec. To me it's too chaotic and my brain can't keep up with what I have to do at the moment since there's so much to do at a time. Meanwhile, my seniors love it when I help them with their work but hates it when they have to help me. Today I felt like I finally hit a nerve.

I realize that I should be investing this amount instead of having it sitting around doing nothing. I grew up in a household that was not very financially savvy (into investing) so I don't have any examples to play off of.

My main question is - Is it a wiser choice to save up this money and invest in a property as soon as possible  or should I experiment with other forms of investment (epf, stock market, etc). If property investment is the better choice, then should I think about buying a property in sg (not sure how possible this is with the absurd property prices in sg right now) or back in my.

y661y1,MalaysianPF,1665997517.0,"I'll continue to post my thoughts here seeing how the previous post had spark some discussion and ideas that I did not thought of. Reminder : I am a n00b when it comes to stock market.

FBM KLCI is up a bit but still low at around 1390 points. All the bluechip stocks bounced from their lows. REITs continues to go down making certain stocks like KIPREIT an interesting buy, if they continue their dividend level of around 7% last year. This was mentioned in one of the comments as well. 

Someone touched on Efficient Market Theory in the comments of my last post as well. This is too complicated of a subject to be discussed here. Warren Buffet himself argued against this theory but recommend Index Fund for most investors. It is not a contradiction. On that note, I found the ticker FBM KLCI ETF (0820EA) on Rakuten but it does not look liquid. VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) can be purchased from Rakuten as well. It is down USD 78.70 from it peak of USD 109 in November 2021. I am only on Rakuten so my knowledge of availability of ETFs / Index Funds is limited.

There were some who are against putting money in Bursa Malaysia due to uncertainty of Malaysia economy. They are right. Stock market is volatile and Bursa Malaysia is no exception. Solution is VT (above). Someone mentioned that when it comes to stock market, you should only put money you can afford to lose. This is correct as well. 

I would like to recommend 2 books : 

1. The Psychology of Money by Morgen Housel
2. The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham 

The first book is an easy read which you finish in 1 weekend. It teaches human behavior with money and will make you conscious of your relationship with money. Everyone has a relationship with money so everyone should read it, especially those in sub-reddit.

The second book is a difficult read. Although it is an old book, I believe it can mold the right mindset when one is trying to invest into the stock market. Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffet's mentor. Will you become the next Warren Buffet after reading it? Of course not. But reading the book is the first step in understanding how he invests. 

I would love to hear your thoughts and thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

Recently, I received 2 offers for a software engineering internship, 1 by a large MNC (quite tech-focused) in Malaysia and another by a tech startup with 1 office in the US and the tech office in Vietnam. Both pay quite well and are both filled with smart people that I like to learn from, although I went through more interview rounds for the tech startup (5 in total). I am leaning towards the startup role as it seems to be more challenging (from the interviews) and I like the team more during the interview, however, parents are of course leaning towards the MNC in Malaysia.

What would your advice be for me and anything I should bear in mind or look out for? Anyone got any experience working abroad for a short term?

Here's the comparison that I had in mind:

Vietnamese Startup

\- Flying off to Ho Chi Minh City for 3 months

\- Small scale with 10+ engineers

\- Internship abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

\- Stipend is very generous to cover accommodation, food, with additional expenses

\- Engineers are people who worked/interned at top companies (Paypal, Twitter, Facebook) / studied at good unis abroad

\- Difficult to tell if a return offer is possible (since I'm not their citizen)

\- Scam? Dangerous? With what's happening in the news recently

&#x200B;

Malaysian MNC

\- Large scale with 100+ engineers

\- Largely stable (reputable among Malaysian engineers)

\- Return offer is possible and common among interns",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/xqz1c0/internship_abroad_career_advice/,[Internship Abroad Career Advice],Career,16,36,0.85

Currently, I'm receiving an allowance of RM800 every month. Dad usually gives me about RM250 and sometimes Mom would let me borrow some in case of an emergency but I still need to pay her back at the end of the month. Lately, it's been harder and harder to get by and I'm currently doing Lalamove deliveries to cover my expenses but I only have one and a half days where I'm free to do it. I've calculated the average of what I spend in a month.

**Income**:

Allowance:RM800

From Dad: RM250

Lalamove (before factoring in petrol and toll and does vary depending on how many jobs are available): RM400

**Expenses**:

Rent:RM200

Utilities: RM33

Netflix/Spotify/Prepaid/Internet: RM80

Petrol: RM350*

Toll: RM150*

Groceries: RM160

Breakfast/Lunch: RM240

BNPL Payments:RM137.50**

Borrowed Money: RM200

*/ -depends on where I'm being placed during the on-the-job training

** -This month would be the last month of paying my phone off 

As you can see, I'm already way off on what I have and how much I spend.

Not sure if I can slash the budget for breakfast/lunch as usually I would get a big breakfast and skip lunch.

vnat0m,MalaysianPF,1656491364.0,"Hi all I am 29/m/engaged, looking to purchase a new car before June 30 to replace my currently 11 years old Myvi. Some background about myself:

1. Gross income: RM 7500-8000
2. Net income: RM 6500-7000
3. Savings per month: RM 3000-3500

My fianc√©e earns about the same with me so that makes the household income about RM 13-14k. We live in KV. It‚Äôs likely that we might have a child or two maximum in coming years. 

I want to buy a car that can last 10 years. I have been reading about Honda City RS (RM 104k OTR price) which is a hybrid fuel saving car as my job requires me to travel quite lot about 200-300km every week and I thought it‚Äôs somehow acceptable to buy a hybrid car now amidst the rising fuel prices. I also like the aesthetic and the functionality of the car after test driving it. 

Is it a financially wise move to buy this car considering the macro environment is worsening now? I need to fork out about RM 900++ to pay the monthly car loan for 9 years. The reason of taking 9 years loan is because I have better use of my money, DCA a fixed sum of money into stock market every month. 

I understand that the inflation poses a risk and the fuel price might go down in the foreseeable future. My second choice is a Toyota Vios E 2021 which I need to pay RM 720 per month for 9 years. Thanks for your input. Much appreciated.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind inputs. I decided to withdraw my car booking for now. I think this SST discount is affecting my judgment, making me FOMO. I need to take a step back and re evaluate my financial health and perhaps I‚Äôll look into cheaper local fuel saving cars like Bezza.
