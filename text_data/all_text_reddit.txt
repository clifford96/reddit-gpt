Anwar refused to use a new Mercedes bought by the government before entering office and said he doesn't want any more expenses being made on him. Literal chad.. nan. So who gets to ride on the merc?. Cringe or not, this is a smart way to align himself to the supporters of PN by showing that he is people friendly PM. By having this kind of down to earth image, people will be more supportive towards him and have better outlook at his administration. 

Current voters base are so divisive hence this kind of PR are needed to soften those that opposed his tenure.. https://preview.redd.it/hl7i0nw3in2a1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8aed4229c8cc84d96c916b9e003db00c6632b4c7

These comments burn 🔥. Smart move. That Merc probably has been bugged to the max.. Small gesture but appreciated. 

What I prefer to see is a reduction in MP benefits, too many idiots trying to become MPs not to serve but to get pension. I recall SS even showing elaun pinggan mangkuk for 400k wtf is that even about, is everyone getting wedgewood kitchen sets?. DSAI probably will be known as Bapa Twitter. /jk

On other hand, very refreshing to see Prime Ministers so active on Social Media on matter of governance. Does anyone know if DSAI has a PR team to handle this for him?. He is setting bar real high. He knows his position is precarious, so he is using all the time he has to win as many future votes as possible. I also hope he is not building a personality cult. That would suck.. Make sure your house car is bulletproof then. PAS be like - " Dibs on that Mercedes!!!!!!". Anwar has always portrayed modesty and conservatism in his life. What he is doing now is doubling down on these traits because he is leveraging it against UMNO and GPS. By constantly advertising his modesty and conservative on social media, he is showcasing that he is the 'man of the people'. He wants to get the support of as many people as possible, so that if UMNO or GPS decides to pull out, he can immediately rally the people to direct their anger to UMNO or GPS....*see, they don't want unity, they are greedy, they don't care about the people, not like me*

i find it cringy, but most Malaysians are simpletons so this strategy will most probably work. That's great and all that he is walking the talk but that being said most likely the car is signed under a lease programme for a duration of a few years and they'll be contractually obliged to still pay even though its not used. I guess it'll be better to put it to use in the meantime? Otherwise it'll literally go to waste. Anwar's personal driver be punching the air for being denied to drive fancier cars the next 5 years.. Looking at you pas 👀. It's like bringing your own container of water. Maybe I'm reading too much into it?. RM700k at least for that fucking car.. Wait...so does that mean the Jabatan will get a brand new car for every newly elected PM?. Since when did the official cars got changed to Mercs? Did I miss something? It used to be Protons (Perdana then Inspiras then Accordanas). Didnt realise it got changed to Mercs. He's building a cult.. I believe the vehicle is leased from company like Spanco. Just to recap the issues come to light when it was revealed that government is paying [~ RM4,850 per month per vehicle (Vellfire & Accordana) ](https://paultan.org/2021/11/08/toyota-vellfire-minister-car-cheaper-than-perdana/) to Spanco.

Spanco has government leasing contract since 1994.. Source: https://twitter.com/anwaribrahim/status/1596890010988720128?t=WtSzojBQQCKPwxx7wn_hHg&s=19. then they gave it to Hamidi 😂. *Salty Hadi noises in background*. Ok, not necessary to tweet it but somehow it just give a vibe of “here a video I donate a lot of money to homeless”. Maybe just me having bad thoughts toward people, kinda wrong to think like thst. Wait so the department already bought it and in the following tweet he said he don't wanna incur anymore extra cost and he'll used whatever car that they already have but they already got the merc.... just use it la. Is this sub about to become an Anwar circlejerk? And no, I'm not a hater and personally see him as the best outcome from this election.. a Prime minister that I could be proud of, wow never had that. Must be Penyu bought the car lor...kek. Penyu must be crying now cannot use his new Merz....then how? Car already bought? Keep also value will goes down. Sell it back?. I support him but is it bad that this kinda sounds like humble bragging to me lol. I think he better listen to his security chief before making such decisions. Fought so hard to get the PM post.

Why? 
- Definitely not for the pay. Essentially a PM without PM salary.
- Not for the perks. No renovations, no new car, etc.
- Break from speeches? Nope. He continues to speak to the general masses - even where he got his traditional Malay capal. 
- Not only he announced holiday for entire country that he himself didn't take, he worked throughout the weekend - with no pay.
- Leans toward pragmatic solutions, and does away with wasteful conventions. Focusses on making life better for the general masses. 

Yet, we still hear voices trying to topple him.

Those still hating him and scheming to bring down the current govt, what is wrong with you? 😭. Sigma. “I wish to inform everyone that I am a modest, selfless person”

That’s the vibe this is giving me. Its too on the nose. Man's not a merc guy. He's obviously a BMW guy with his 7 series.. But if bought already then the car how? Can get sent back for refund meh?. Literal Chad? Anwar hasn't even been in office for a week and y'all are idolizing this man already?!

What is so impressive with forgoing a Merc when he already has the latest 7 series with the long wheelbase? Our economy isn't doing so hot, frugality only makes sense. There's nothing mind blowing about it.

Y'all can downvote as much as you want, but the fanboys need to calm your hyper erogenous tits because y'all are showing signs of bias-ness. Politicians are here to serve us and to do the right thing. Stop idolizing them over the most basic thing because you need to be ready to boot them in the ass when they fuck up.. Nicezzz. Tbh i dont care, when is the cabinet being announced??. you dont go around saying youre doing good things. masuk bakul angkat sendiri shit. Respect 100. A good PR move. Just like a good written speech for Mahiadin back in the days.

This is how you win the Rakyat confidence, not some people who get 3.8 CGPA but "kalau ayam Mahal tak payah makan ayam" comments.. Kalau dah beli kenapa tak guna? Or baru tender nak beli belum lepas payment? Kalau nak jual balik berapa susut nilai dia?. Sounds like a deliberate showoff but ok.. aiya just use it la... money already spent.. PR stunt. Unpopular opinion, our head of state should be taking or riding quality cars for safety and image purpose. Imagine Joe Biden driving Myvi, make the country look bad.

But below PM like Menteri should be just Proton Perdana which has the official and formal look.. So what car does he drive?. what happened to Anwar’s Lexus LS?. PAS is triggered by this.. Well he is a BMW guy 🤣. Good start, extend it to other Ministries to empower them to do the same. Austerity will go a long way to ensure this government walks the talk.

Empower the Audit Negara to initiate check and balance for expense claims too. We have been overpaying our politicians so much that turning down a Mercedes is a key gesture. Good on Anwar to do this. Set more examples of declining “Doing this because I can”.. No unnecessary spending and public sector bloat? I'm starting to think he may be on to something here.... i understand this gesture and what message it represents. yet we still see negativity on socmed. hilarious.. I mean isn't that car was made for his safety?. Based. It sets a pretty good precedent, ie, if this guy can do it, why must other future ministers insist on having outlandish Benzes?. Ok la, he don't use the car, since he has his own BMW 7 series already (BEM 1 also expensive number plate) but the car will be used by someone else anyway. Can it be sold?. Lalang 😂😂. Future PM after Anwar is going to have to look real unpopular the moment he wants to reinstate all the PM salary and benefits that was turned down by Anwar.. >Anwar refused to use a new Mercedes

-Say no more. The headline on BH caught me off guard for a moment. It essentially says "Anwar likes to drive his car". I thought to myself, well no shit.. chad. Give to me then. It was bought by the previous PM. i hope anwar still has this attitude later on and not become like the rest trying to exploit the rakyat. Shipping it to Kelantan for some vote of confidence. Why ride when we can sell it say it was own by anwar it become a collector edition. Yup, this is the rational thing to do when you become a PM. I dont know why PN straight up bought velfires. Isnt it obvious that makes them look bad?

People who inherit power really are stupid.. Backfire
"Tak perlu Merc sebab Yahudi/Cina DAP dah sponsor". Still better than Moo's Kak Piah Pisang Goreng story.. lmao banished them straight back to stone age.

kidding they already there.. No wonder they use german car. Because back in the day, the leader hate jews and what party that also say jews is the problem? PAS. 


/s. Should be given to moodin, hopefully his attendance will improve. I thought he’s already in full fitness and physically well. No more sakit excuses, otherwise how to become PM if you are not fit?. Subscribe to unlimit your max speed for just $999.99 per month

Its not just a small gesture. By publicly setting the tone, he is discouraging future cabinet members and current senior civil servants from spending money on unnecessary luxuries that were previously a given.. Didn't he state that he won't be taking salary?

I really hope he turns Malaysia around... I think being betrayed the way he was really could change him.. Need to be careful with that. If too drastic, some of them will go meeting under the blanket to change gov. Tired la. He also reported on news that he won't makes "MP seat as reward" he claim that there is too much MP cabinet for everything and defeated the purpose of making a MP seat. Only people that deserving of one get it instead of being awarded as one for doing something.. That's the same issue in so many countries, MP is a dream seat with too many privileges. > Does anyone know if DSAI has a PR team to handle this for him?

Pretty sure every world leader has a PR/media person/team. Whether said leader listen to his guy/team is another matter.. Trump literally using Twitter as his governance tool, and Najib using his FB like this as well.. Of course lah, you think all the PMs so free meh.. twitter? thats millennia & gen Z stuff, tiktok is Gen alpha stuff.

EDIT: My point is I think he need to use that too, it is what that stupid app influencing the young voters. it is what PN has been using it to win more in GE15.. Iirc fahmi fadzil is the comms director kan?. Bapa Ciapan Malaysian. I swear why are people like this, yea DSAI is so far an excellent example for Malaysia's PM but that is not a high bar to begin with. People need to stop idealize other people like their perfect. You're setting yourself up for dissapointment or preassuring them in an unnecessary way.. dude, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of Anwar **fanatics**. Mat Sabu's car is pretty good. Government car pool manager: "Anwar, we need to spend 2 million dollars to make your Camry bulletproof".. It is not about the car is BMW but more of the fact that any PM's, king's, sultan's, president's car is normally need to be bullet proof. And there is not many car with international standard bullet proof.. But is it halal ?. Avarice is sinful in Islam, but waraq Ulemas are excepted.. It’s a smart strategy against the religion abusers.

For show or not, at least he is showing that he is doing the stuff rather than divisive speech or fear mongering.. He also always appear with his sleeve folded rather than buttoned up. That is public image 101 to appeal to masses as working leader.  He always wears white or blue shirt or those shades color jacket or black. He only have his apple watch, no other watch on his wrist to showcase that he is about function than esthatic, basic rather than luxury. I also notice he wears a lot more baju melayu since the sworn in, perhaps trying to appeal to Malay majorities.

The man is putting in the work into his image. It could be him all the way, who he is as a human being or it could be just a PR campaign. Whatever it is, it is working out thus far. 

Just my 2 cents armchair PR analysis.. Whatever works to keep other coalitions in check. Nothing more cringy than whatever the previous admin has done.. Cringier than Sabri and his endless collection of exorbitant and entirely unflattering luxury shirts? 

I’d rather watch someone disingenuously model humility and financial prudence than see yet another boomer act like a baller on my taxpayer dime and still look like they bought their wardrobe at the pasar malam.. I agree. It's a good strategy. But it's not cringy. Then what the hell you expect him to do? Sit down quietly? Then you all say he no do work!. Agree. He's not stupid, politicians being politicians.. I like it because it makes the greedy fucks look bad.. I like it, it will make modesty a trend. Because we are not the target audience. At least he’s leading by example and it’s not just a gimmick if he’s been doing it all his life. Compare to those Melayu Isley leaders who can’t even be transparent about their assets or expensive wardrobe. Jihad tangani inflasi konon. While I agree with you on the practical aspect, there is also a symbolic aspect that I hope you guys would give importance to.

When the PM himself decides to not take a salary and don't travel around in a luxury car, it sends a message to those below that **being wasteful with resources is no longer acceptable.** Even those public servants who don't care would feel the pressure if they carry on with their old ways. This message will also go all the way to various states of the country, where some Chief Ministers famously acquired a lot of Mercs for themselves.

We need to give this time. Wait for a time when the public in Kedah or Kelantan will question their state and ruling party leaders about their wasteful spending of state resources.. Pick up heads of state when they visit? Except any US president and VP of course.

My synical view is probably Anwar got better car already and much rather use that than some outdated Merc. Plus can claim milage and fuel from the government lo.. I dont know why we need Sedan, a Toyato land cruiser probably more useful. Or a toyato alphad. 

No need a Merc that can buy a couple of toyatas.. i think its more symbolic than anything else. hes setting the tone that the government is cutting away at useless luxuries. He's already driving his boss around in a 2021 BMW 7 series so this car is a sidegrade at best.

These cars are comfortable to sit in but aren't the best driving experiences.. He already sits in a high spec 7 series with the car plate of BEN1 or something. Around 1/2 of the cost is duty. Government vehicle doesn't need to pay any duty because its like paying money from left pocket to right pocket. So its probably closer to 350k. I hope thats not the case.. else taxpayers would have bought around 3-4 cars in the past few years. Accordanas? I thought they were called Hondanas or Pondanas?. His cult is pretty much PKR tbh.. he is strengthening his cult. he's already a cult lol. He's taking down the PAScult.. Is 4,850 considered reasonable against market rate?. Probably not a good PR move to use the car when his policies are aimed to be economic and people centric. They can give it back or use it for visiting foreign dignitaries.. Lepaklah. People still in honeymoon period. Wait until he start to announce his policies. You can't please everyone so expect the brickbats will come when cabinet is announced and major decisions are tabled in Parliment.
A new Budget 2023 needs to be tabled too. I expect there will be some unhappy people when they compare to BN's 2023 unrealistic budget.. Haters gotta hate, without haters there would no be "you" and on the bright side they'll just make you more encouraged. You're a sucker for those sigma videos huh.. Then the message is not for you. It is for others who doubted his clean image and efforts to keep the Malaysian government clean.. Unless the government procurement is stupid AF (which is not a remote chance given past history), the car should be leased. Cancelling lease should be less costly than reselling a car.. A luxury car isn't automatically safer than a non luxury car.. His BMW 7 series. Which is on par with Audi A8 and S600. But some says the car is rented for Election purposes. So who knows?

EDIT: The BMW is not owned by him, the “his” is just to refer the BMW he is driving.. If he already has his own Lexus, he won't need a Mercedes.. Yeah that's what I was wondering about, I heard about the car being fortified for safety.. This must be the sign of god that I must own the Merc. Big brain. Get this person into politics quick!. [removed]. >  Isnt it obvious that makes them look bad? 

It really depends on which voter base is looking sadly ... bad to us, *"God given right"* to them. If PAS became the gov we'd be having a 2nd stone age.

Let the stoning begin..  As the saying goes for bombing the Taliban back to the Stone Age: It would be an improvement for them. i think he still has stomachache whenever there is a need for a vote.. looking at msia's roads...he wont need any extra speed or pickup. and what’s more important is to stop this greedy people to aim for political career and leave it for someone who really wants to serve the country. Yeah he didnt save any money given its already procured.

Its to preempt everyone not to spend unnecessarily. 

If he is actually brave, scrap all these unnecessary allowance and budget.. Yes, tone from the top can be very influential to create an org culture. He be doing 4D chess plays here.. He's well off. His revealed assets shows he's pretty comfortable compared to us. 

I honestly have no issue for MPs getting paid for doing their job, but it needs to reflect the current market rate. Perhaps a minimum wage plus allowance should suffice especially they need to understand how difficult it is for the B40s struggling with that.. Hr wont take allowance of PM but he still take the salary as an MP like any other MP. > Didn't he state that he won't be taking salary?

Yes. But he is still taking allowances. Salary is earning/compensation for his time and effort for the job. Allowances are monies that enable him to do his job as PM. He is not expensing overhead of his PM role out off pocket, they are covered by allowances.. I would think so. Saying that, Donald Trump might just be the glaring exception. 

Pretty sure the only thing that fella was willing to working overtime for was twitter.. Twitter's got nothing on MySpace. That's the OG social media platform.. "Gen Alpha" this person says. 🤣🤣🤣. ew tiktok, yuck. I'm glad that there are others aware of the ridiculous fanboy-ism happening for Anwar.

Not even a week in and people talking as though Anwar took the country to the next level. Ridiculous.. I like your power of observation ie. how the past leaders had set the bar friggin low to begin with for DSAI. lolz. mf's pulling a jibby, hopefully not the 2.6 billion rm part of jibby. This is what I scared, people kept praising him too much, idolised him that it might going to hurt his image if he didn't noticed this soon and put a stop on it. People were worshipping mahathir after ge14. I spotted him in Sunway pyramid shortly after the election and he was being mobbed by people asking for selfies.. Where did you hear the sleeve folding adage from? It’s quite interesting and I’d like to read more about it and portraying that image if you can find a source.. Yeah got ya, lead by example basically!. I called this move the ‘reverse Burberry’. I understand the message behind his move, but honestly, I don't care if he's taking salary or forgoing a Merc, those aren't the real KPIs and the Anwar fanatics need to open their eyes and not fall in love too deeply.. >Even those public servants who don't care would feel the pressure if they carry on with their old ways.

Nah, they would just keep making new "kursus" to cover the shortfall. I mean I see dozens of Kastam/LHDN kursus letter in the office inbox, let alone the ones for my actual industry from other government departments.. This. It sends a message, and what a ballsy fucking message it is. Some people need to hear it.. Haha, you're kinda right, his car that he used the past week was the latest BMW 7 Series. So not to say he is downgrading by not using this S600. S600 Merc is Maybach, no? Pretty decent upgrade still. Imagine Malaysia in a free-market, S class cost 350k and the road will be filled with S classes lol.. Paul Tan called them Accordanas. Oi spit out my teh tarik. Yeah when Azmin and gang left the party, it was a total cleanup of PKR, removing every member that wouldn't support Anwar as PM candidate.. This. Public servants should empathize people who are already suffering economically.. But the car was bought previously, not by him. Letting a new car just sit in some car park is worse imo unless they give it to someone else to use it. Giving back a car is a lost. It depreciates as soon as you get the keys. Yeah dude literally just got elected and people are treating him like he can do no wrong. I am hopeful, but prepared to be disappointed too.. Given the government with BN (which I think is necessary) it's quite likely his policies won't be as liberal as this subreddit hopes.. But that's good politics. Politik matang.. Well, i think they bought it. Then when whoever using the car can outright buy it after 5 years. For a very good price. And since the po was created during PM9, this seems more likely.. Article links above say the BMW was loaned to him. No car assets declared under his name.. Imo a much better choice than a merc and audi.. Oi, nak masuk neraka ke?. Looking at GE-15 results, it has already begun.... This! We actually need to trim the fat so that discourage greedy people to run for office and open up opportunity and remove barrier for people who are genuinely passionate about humanitary/wellfare and societal good to join the gov. >I honestly have no issue for MPs getting paid for doing their job,

Absolutely agree.  It's when they abused their position. 

Najib was rumoured to  have a $1M+ power bill/yr.. paid for by the public.  Then buying Hermes bags for his hippo and get justified by "a guy can't buy his wife bags?"

Here's to hoping a golden age for Malaysia... His declared assets only about RM11 million...really not much..think USD. Not even $3m USD.

Meanwhile ...Ku Nan....got nearly RM 1 billion asset. A few millions to Ku Nan is just chump change.. Iirc Out of rm11 mil, rm10 mil of them are in terms of assets, like the 3(4?) houses he owns. So his only cash is under rm1 mil which is to me is still not considered as comfy living.. He also has all his pensions reinstated after his pardon. He is fine.. DT has a PR team, it consists of his sons, daughters, in-law & morons. 

No competent people would stay in a PR team where your opinions, advice & suggestions are ignored all the time.. Wait i thought it was Friendster 😂. come on buddy, tiktok is the best when i can see people do stupid stuffs and laugh about it while complaining why kids around us follow stupid trends!. I read it in an article when psychologist analyzing Obama's images from his first term presidential campaign. I cannot find the article anymore however you may find some interesting findings here: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2016.1201967](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2016.1201967) Although it wasn't fully on Obama, it tells a lot of the messages behind a picture and how deliberate one could be in staging the picture based on what they intended to project. One of another finding that I find it interesting is that people analyze Obama's watch. He wore a Tag Heuer diver watch that cost less than USD 600; a working class watch. As you guess it, it is also deliberate to showcase his working class image. You can read more on Obama here in  a study on Obama's pictures. [https://www.academia.edu/32225315/Image\_Control\_Image\_Control\_The\_Visual\_Rhetoric\_of\_President\_Obama](https://www.academia.edu/32225315/Image_Control_Image_Control_The_Visual_Rhetoric_of_President_Obama). The BMW was temporarily loaned by the owner of ~~Pantai Hospital~~ Pantai Bharu during campaign period. He has since returned it. 

The S600 is on lease so not using it means not having to renew the lease for the next 5 years. The official government car that he’ll be using is a Toyota Camry.

Edit: Toyota Camry [here](https://twitter.com/ravinp_69/status/1597193967841705989?s=46&t=BenPFKoJNQm9sTiO6GpFrg). Looks like managed to cancel to Mercedes order made by the previous government? Doesn’t sound like a lease to me. I don’t know what to believe anymore.. A fun hot hatch like the VW Golf GTI would also only cost around RM 120k which might mean a lot more people racing on the roads lol. This is the kind of justification which PAS and the other greedy fucks might use. It's good to see Anwar neuter these justifications.. Well, he could sell it and use the money for something else while going in for a new toyota camry?. It's a loss either way, at least if he doesn't use it the trade in value will be higher.

Also since this is the PMs car, Mercedes will probably just give back the full amount as a gesture of good will.

We aren't selling a car on mudah here.. Sunk cost fallacy on full display.. All my Mercedes, gone.. >Yeah dude literally just got elected and people are treating him like he can do no wrong.

Based on what I'm seeing, I don't think people are treating him like some infallible saint. People are starting to be a little proud for once, because they're seeing someone who fulfills the bare minimum of at least *trying to look like he gives a shit,* which is more than we could say for a lot of the previous guys.. I know, the “his” is just to refer the car he is driving not owned by him.. Saya atheist! Lmao. I agree with you but how can we attract competent and educated people to join politics other than money?. Oh this won't be easy, I'm sure MPs from both sides would rage if that was done. 

>Najib was rumoured to have a $1M+ power bill/yr.. paid for by the public. Then buying Hermes bags for his hippo and get justified by "a guy can't buy his wife bags?"

The wife said she spent a grand on her hair alone. Her Marie Antoinette moment.. Didnt know jibby had a pet hippo. You're right not much but more than most of us here do. He can eat nasi campur and order seafood, I can't.. I don't know about you, but I don't have that amount of money either. You can survive with far less than that.. Youre' right, forgot about that one. XD. Lenin and Stalin are the same too. Lenin with his everyday business shirt signifying that he is the leader of the common workers, and Stalin only smoking from a cheap tobacco pipe.. Thanks so much for the links! The first article was very interesting and has inspired me for my work.. Ah okay. Mind if I ask where did you find the info that the BMW was lent? I've always assumed it was Anwar's. >The official government car that he’ll be using is a Toyota Camry. 

Excellent car.. Well, it’s already been returned so a non-issue now. Looks like it’s a Camry from now on.. Honestly, I don’t know. I could give ideas, but they are all my thoughts. But I believe if money is no 1 attraction, then we will attract greedy people. But if so, we could also use money to make them work. The problem right now is even they don’t work, they still get their salary. And even they get even more money of they are corrupt.

Hence, I suggest their salary shouldn’t be decided by their own votes. Maybe make a system that MPs salary can be maximum 10x of the poorest household in his/her parliament only and minimum 3x minimum wage. Haha. See how poverty is solved withon a year only.. They are countries that marketed elected office as a humanitarian career path. Their education reflected this as a clear path, as well as not positioned as inferior to stem or business. The track are gearing the students towards finance, economy, administration, welfare, foreign relation etc. And for those are successfully elected into office they are given allowance, stipend and housing. They are mandated housing within a dense community amongst the constituent. This mandate by design allow/force them to better mingle with their constituent. They are mandated to take the public transport to their parlimentary/house meeting. They are mandated to send all their children to public school system. These forces them to feel the actual consequence of their work in legislation within their own life.

These at least would weed out greedy people. For greedy people, these are seen as a lot of strings attached to the office. But to people who really are on humanitarian mission, they not only not see this as obstacle, but they would be thankful for these mandate since these would actually better help them in their goal to help their community.. He just need to bring back Robert Kuok.. this guy will open up a lot of international business opportunities for Malaysia. 

But after how M screwed him.. doubt that will happen, which is sad.   The guy is a true patriot. You are wrong. Jibby is the Hippo's pet.. Alone probably. Not when we are in a sandwich generation, got dependents, debts, sudden need of cash and future-looking investments.

Again, of course can live but not as comfortable, at least to me.

In case of anwar, although his family semua dah besar, upkeeping his assets need money. He should be ok with rm900k, but he is 75 years old and who’s gonna pay for the upkeep of his assets when his time in this world is up? Again, lots of money compre with average peeps but not as comfy.. Anwar doesn't have a BMW. [He doesn't even have a car under his asset declaration](https://calonkeadilan.org/candidate/P063). 

His wife Wan Azizah has [three cars](https://calonkeadilan.org/candidate/P124) (2 x Myvi, 1 x Toyota Vellfire), his daughter Nurul Izzah has [a Proton](https://calonkeadilan.org/candidate/P044), according to their asset declarations.. He spoke about returning it [here](https://twitter.com/rashidyusoff11/status/1596504325508898818?s=46&t=ql-9YzD3rhvdKLBy4pcILQ)

If you read the comments you can see the owner of the BMW. My bad it’s a company called Pantai Bharu, not related to Pantai Hospital.. Toyota cars are cheaper (relatively) to buy and maintain/repair  plus more reliable. German cars are overengineered and cost a bomb to maintain and repair.. salary based on attendance rate. Not international just China. We need to diversify. In fact, we should be grabbing investors that are leaving China, not relying on Chinese investors. For example, we grovel and beg for them to buy Musang king. Guess what, Hainan in South China now has a musang king plantation already harvesting. They will cut you off when they don't need you anymore.. Thank you!. BMWs put plastic components between two turbochargers and guess why they fail often lol.. Coca Cola cut a deal with Kuok to get a foot hold into China.   I doubt very much Kuok contacts are isolated to only China..

>They will cut you off when they don't need you anymore

That's true for all the countries in the world, unsure why this is even being brought up..

80% of Asian sugar market and 10% of world sugar market. His contacts are definition not just isolated to China/ Asia.. Anwar refused to use a new Mercedes bought by the government before entering office and said he doesn't want any more expenses being made on him. Literal chad.. nan. So who gets to ride on the merc?. Cringe or not, this is a smart way to align himself to the supporters of PN by showing that he is people friendly PM. By having this kind of down to earth image, people will be more supportive towards him and have better outlook at his administration. 

Current voters base are so divisive hence this kind of PR are needed to soften those that opposed his tenure.. https://preview.redd.it/hl7i0nw3in2a1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8aed4229c8cc84d96c916b9e003db00c6632b4c7

These comments burn 🔥. Smart move. That Merc probably has been bugged to the max.. Small gesture but appreciated. 

What I prefer to see is a reduction in MP benefits, too many idiots trying to become MPs not to serve but to get pension. I recall SS even showing elaun pinggan mangkuk for 400k wtf is that even about, is everyone getting wedgewood kitchen sets?. DSAI probably will be known as Bapa Twitter. /jk

On other hand, very refreshing to see Prime Ministers so active on Social Media on matter of governance. Does anyone know if DSAI has a PR team to handle this for him?. He is setting bar real high. He knows his position is precarious, so he is using all the time he has to win as many future votes as possible. I also hope he is not building a personality cult. That would suck.. Make sure your house car is bulletproof then. PAS be like - " Dibs on that Mercedes!!!!!!". Anwar has always portrayed modesty and conservatism in his life. What he is doing now is doubling down on these traits because he is leveraging it against UMNO and GPS. By constantly advertising his modesty and conservative on social media, he is showcasing that he is the 'man of the people'. He wants to get the support of as many people as possible, so that if UMNO or GPS decides to pull out, he can immediately rally the people to direct their anger to UMNO or GPS....*see, they don't want unity, they are greedy, they don't care about the people, not like me*

i find it cringy, but most Malaysians are simpletons so this strategy will most probably work. That's great and all that he is walking the talk but that being said most likely the car is signed under a lease programme for a duration of a few years and they'll be contractually obliged to still pay even though its not used. I guess it'll be better to put it to use in the meantime? Otherwise it'll literally go to waste. Anwar's personal driver be punching the air for being denied to drive fancier cars the next 5 years.. Looking at you pas 👀. It's like bringing your own container of water. Maybe I'm reading too much into it?. RM700k at least for that fucking car.. Wait...so does that mean the Jabatan will get a brand new car for every newly elected PM?. Since when did the official cars got changed to Mercs? Did I miss something? It used to be Protons (Perdana then Inspiras then Accordanas). Didnt realise it got changed to Mercs. He's building a cult.. I believe the vehicle is leased from company like Spanco. Just to recap the issues come to light when it was revealed that government is paying [~ RM4,850 per month per vehicle (Vellfire & Accordana) ](https://paultan.org/2021/11/08/toyota-vellfire-minister-car-cheaper-than-perdana/) to Spanco.

Spanco has government leasing contract since 1994.. Source: https://twitter.com/anwaribrahim/status/1596890010988720128?t=WtSzojBQQCKPwxx7wn_hHg&s=19. then they gave it to Hamidi 😂. *Salty Hadi noises in background*. Ok, not necessary to tweet it but somehow it just give a vibe of “here a video I donate a lot of money to homeless”. Maybe just me having bad thoughts toward people, kinda wrong to think like thst. Wait so the department already bought it and in the following tweet he said he don't wanna incur anymore extra cost and he'll used whatever car that they already have but they already got the merc.... just use it la. Is this sub about to become an Anwar circlejerk? And no, I'm not a hater and personally see him as the best outcome from this election.. a Prime minister that I could be proud of, wow never had that. Must be Penyu bought the car lor...kek. Penyu must be crying now cannot use his new Merz....then how? Car already bought? Keep also value will goes down. Sell it back?. I support him but is it bad that this kinda sounds like humble bragging to me lol. I think he better listen to his security chief before making such decisions. Fought so hard to get the PM post.

Why? 
- Definitely not for the pay. Essentially a PM without PM salary.
- Not for the perks. No renovations, no new car, etc.
- Break from speeches? Nope. He continues to speak to the general masses - even where he got his traditional Malay capal. 
- Not only he announced holiday for entire country that he himself didn't take, he worked throughout the weekend - with no pay.
- Leans toward pragmatic solutions, and does away with wasteful conventions. Focusses on making life better for the general masses. 

Yet, we still hear voices trying to topple him.

Those still hating him and scheming to bring down the current govt, what is wrong with you? 😭. Sigma. “I wish to inform everyone that I am a modest, selfless person”

That’s the vibe this is giving me. Its too on the nose. Man's not a merc guy. He's obviously a BMW guy with his 7 series.. But if bought already then the car how? Can get sent back for refund meh?. Literal Chad? Anwar hasn't even been in office for a week and y'all are idolizing this man already?!

What is so impressive with forgoing a Merc when he already has the latest 7 series with the long wheelbase? Our economy isn't doing so hot, frugality only makes sense. There's nothing mind blowing about it.

Y'all can downvote as much as you want, but the fanboys need to calm your hyper erogenous tits because y'all are showing signs of bias-ness. Politicians are here to serve us and to do the right thing. Stop idolizing them over the most basic thing because you need to be ready to boot them in the ass when they fuck up.. Nicezzz. Tbh i dont care, when is the cabinet being announced??. you dont go around saying youre doing good things. masuk bakul angkat sendiri shit. Respect 100. A good PR move. Just like a good written speech for Mahiadin back in the days.

This is how you win the Rakyat confidence, not some people who get 3.8 CGPA but "kalau ayam Mahal tak payah makan ayam" comments.. Kalau dah beli kenapa tak guna? Or baru tender nak beli belum lepas payment? Kalau nak jual balik berapa susut nilai dia?. Sounds like a deliberate showoff but ok.. aiya just use it la... money already spent.. PR stunt. Unpopular opinion, our head of state should be taking or riding quality cars for safety and image purpose. Imagine Joe Biden driving Myvi, make the country look bad.

But below PM like Menteri should be just Proton Perdana which has the official and formal look.. So what car does he drive?. what happened to Anwar’s Lexus LS?. PAS is triggered by this.. Well he is a BMW guy 🤣. Good start, extend it to other Ministries to empower them to do the same. Austerity will go a long way to ensure this government walks the talk.

Empower the Audit Negara to initiate check and balance for expense claims too. We have been overpaying our politicians so much that turning down a Mercedes is a key gesture. Good on Anwar to do this. Set more examples of declining “Doing this because I can”.. No unnecessary spending and public sector bloat? I'm starting to think he may be on to something here.... i understand this gesture and what message it represents. yet we still see negativity on socmed. hilarious.. I mean isn't that car was made for his safety?. Based. It sets a pretty good precedent, ie, if this guy can do it, why must other future ministers insist on having outlandish Benzes?. Ok la, he don't use the car, since he has his own BMW 7 series already (BEM 1 also expensive number plate) but the car will be used by someone else anyway. Can it be sold?. Lalang 😂😂. Future PM after Anwar is going to have to look real unpopular the moment he wants to reinstate all the PM salary and benefits that was turned down by Anwar.. >Anwar refused to use a new Mercedes

-Say no more. The headline on BH caught me off guard for a moment. It essentially says "Anwar likes to drive his car". I thought to myself, well no shit.. chad. Give to me then. It was bought by the previous PM. i hope anwar still has this attitude later on and not become like the rest trying to exploit the rakyat. Shipping it to Kelantan for some vote of confidence. Why ride when we can sell it say it was own by anwar it become a collector edition. Yup, this is the rational thing to do when you become a PM. I dont know why PN straight up bought velfires. Isnt it obvious that makes them look bad?

People who inherit power really are stupid.. Backfire
"Tak perlu Merc sebab Yahudi/Cina DAP dah sponsor". Still better than Moo's Kak Piah Pisang Goreng story.. lmao banished them straight back to stone age.

kidding they already there.. No wonder they use german car. Because back in the day, the leader hate jews and what party that also say jews is the problem? PAS. 


/s. Should be given to moodin, hopefully his attendance will improve. I thought he’s already in full fitness and physically well. No more sakit excuses, otherwise how to become PM if you are not fit?. Subscribe to unlimit your max speed for just $999.99 per month

Its not just a small gesture. By publicly setting the tone, he is discouraging future cabinet members and current senior civil servants from spending money on unnecessary luxuries that were previously a given.. Didn't he state that he won't be taking salary?

I really hope he turns Malaysia around... I think being betrayed the way he was really could change him.. Need to be careful with that. If too drastic, some of them will go meeting under the blanket to change gov. Tired la. He also reported on news that he won't makes "MP seat as reward" he claim that there is too much MP cabinet for everything and defeated the purpose of making a MP seat. Only people that deserving of one get it instead of being awarded as one for doing something.. That's the same issue in so many countries, MP is a dream seat with too many privileges. > Does anyone know if DSAI has a PR team to handle this for him?

Pretty sure every world leader has a PR/media person/team. Whether said leader listen to his guy/team is another matter.. Trump literally using Twitter as his governance tool, and Najib using his FB like this as well.. Of course lah, you think all the PMs so free meh.. twitter? thats millennia & gen Z stuff, tiktok is Gen alpha stuff.

EDIT: My point is I think he need to use that too, it is what that stupid app influencing the young voters. it is what PN has been using it to win more in GE15.. Iirc fahmi fadzil is the comms director kan?. Bapa Ciapan Malaysian. I swear why are people like this, yea DSAI is so far an excellent example for Malaysia's PM but that is not a high bar to begin with. People need to stop idealize other people like their perfect. You're setting yourself up for dissapointment or preassuring them in an unnecessary way.. dude, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of Anwar **fanatics**. Mat Sabu's car is pretty good. Government car pool manager: "Anwar, we need to spend 2 million dollars to make your Camry bulletproof".. It is not about the car is BMW but more of the fact that any PM's, king's, sultan's, president's car is normally need to be bullet proof. And there is not many car with international standard bullet proof.. But is it halal ?. Avarice is sinful in Islam, but waraq Ulemas are excepted.. It’s a smart strategy against the religion abusers.

For show or not, at least he is showing that he is doing the stuff rather than divisive speech or fear mongering.. He also always appear with his sleeve folded rather than buttoned up. That is public image 101 to appeal to masses as working leader.  He always wears white or blue shirt or those shades color jacket or black. He only have his apple watch, no other watch on his wrist to showcase that he is about function than esthatic, basic rather than luxury. I also notice he wears a lot more baju melayu since the sworn in, perhaps trying to appeal to Malay majorities.

The man is putting in the work into his image. It could be him all the way, who he is as a human being or it could be just a PR campaign. Whatever it is, it is working out thus far. 

Just my 2 cents armchair PR analysis.. Whatever works to keep other coalitions in check. Nothing more cringy than whatever the previous admin has done.. Cringier than Sabri and his endless collection of exorbitant and entirely unflattering luxury shirts? 

I’d rather watch someone disingenuously model humility and financial prudence than see yet another boomer act like a baller on my taxpayer dime and still look like they bought their wardrobe at the pasar malam.. I agree. It's a good strategy. But it's not cringy. Then what the hell you expect him to do? Sit down quietly? Then you all say he no do work!. Agree. He's not stupid, politicians being politicians.. I like it because it makes the greedy fucks look bad.. I like it, it will make modesty a trend. Because we are not the target audience. At least he’s leading by example and it’s not just a gimmick if he’s been doing it all his life. Compare to those Melayu Isley leaders who can’t even be transparent about their assets or expensive wardrobe. Jihad tangani inflasi konon. While I agree with you on the practical aspect, there is also a symbolic aspect that I hope you guys would give importance to.

When the PM himself decides to not take a salary and don't travel around in a luxury car, it sends a message to those below that **being wasteful with resources is no longer acceptable.** Even those public servants who don't care would feel the pressure if they carry on with their old ways. This message will also go all the way to various states of the country, where some Chief Ministers famously acquired a lot of Mercs for themselves.

We need to give this time. Wait for a time when the public in Kedah or Kelantan will question their state and ruling party leaders about their wasteful spending of state resources.. Pick up heads of state when they visit? Except any US president and VP of course.

My synical view is probably Anwar got better car already and much rather use that than some outdated Merc. Plus can claim milage and fuel from the government lo.. I dont know why we need Sedan, a Toyato land cruiser probably more useful. Or a toyato alphad. 

No need a Merc that can buy a couple of toyatas.. i think its more symbolic than anything else. hes setting the tone that the government is cutting away at useless luxuries. He's already driving his boss around in a 2021 BMW 7 series so this car is a sidegrade at best.

These cars are comfortable to sit in but aren't the best driving experiences.. He already sits in a high spec 7 series with the car plate of BEN1 or something. Around 1/2 of the cost is duty. Government vehicle doesn't need to pay any duty because its like paying money from left pocket to right pocket. So its probably closer to 350k. I hope thats not the case.. else taxpayers would have bought around 3-4 cars in the past few years. Accordanas? I thought they were called Hondanas or Pondanas?. His cult is pretty much PKR tbh.. he is strengthening his cult. he's already a cult lol. He's taking down the PAScult.. Is 4,850 considered reasonable against market rate?. Probably not a good PR move to use the car when his policies are aimed to be economic and people centric. They can give it back or use it for visiting foreign dignitaries.. Lepaklah. People still in honeymoon period. Wait until he start to announce his policies. You can't please everyone so expect the brickbats will come when cabinet is announced and major decisions are tabled in Parliment.
A new Budget 2023 needs to be tabled too. I expect there will be some unhappy people when they compare to BN's 2023 unrealistic budget.. Haters gotta hate, without haters there would no be "you" and on the bright side they'll just make you more encouraged. You're a sucker for those sigma videos huh.. Then the message is not for you. It is for others who doubted his clean image and efforts to keep the Malaysian government clean.. Unless the government procurement is stupid AF (which is not a remote chance given past history), the car should be leased. Cancelling lease should be less costly than reselling a car.. A luxury car isn't automatically safer than a non luxury car.. His BMW 7 series. Which is on par with Audi A8 and S600. But some says the car is rented for Election purposes. So who knows?

EDIT: The BMW is not owned by him, the “his” is just to refer the BMW he is driving.. If he already has his own Lexus, he won't need a Mercedes.. Yeah that's what I was wondering about, I heard about the car being fortified for safety.. This must be the sign of god that I must own the Merc. Big brain. Get this person into politics quick!. [removed]. >  Isnt it obvious that makes them look bad? 

It really depends on which voter base is looking sadly ... bad to us, *"God given right"* to them. If PAS became the gov we'd be having a 2nd stone age.

Let the stoning begin..  As the saying goes for bombing the Taliban back to the Stone Age: It would be an improvement for them. i think he still has stomachache whenever there is a need for a vote.. looking at msia's roads...he wont need any extra speed or pickup. and what’s more important is to stop this greedy people to aim for political career and leave it for someone who really wants to serve the country. Yeah he didnt save any money given its already procured.

Its to preempt everyone not to spend unnecessarily. 

If he is actually brave, scrap all these unnecessary allowance and budget.. Yes, tone from the top can be very influential to create an org culture. He be doing 4D chess plays here.. He's well off. His revealed assets shows he's pretty comfortable compared to us. 

I honestly have no issue for MPs getting paid for doing their job, but it needs to reflect the current market rate. Perhaps a minimum wage plus allowance should suffice especially they need to understand how difficult it is for the B40s struggling with that.. Hr wont take allowance of PM but he still take the salary as an MP like any other MP. > Didn't he state that he won't be taking salary?

Yes. But he is still taking allowances. Salary is earning/compensation for his time and effort for the job. Allowances are monies that enable him to do his job as PM. He is not expensing overhead of his PM role out off pocket, they are covered by allowances.. I would think so. Saying that, Donald Trump might just be the glaring exception. 

Pretty sure the only thing that fella was willing to working overtime for was twitter.. Twitter's got nothing on MySpace. That's the OG social media platform.. "Gen Alpha" this person says. 🤣🤣🤣. ew tiktok, yuck. I'm glad that there are others aware of the ridiculous fanboy-ism happening for Anwar.

Not even a week in and people talking as though Anwar took the country to the next level. Ridiculous.. I like your power of observation ie. how the past leaders had set the bar friggin low to begin with for DSAI. lolz. mf's pulling a jibby, hopefully not the 2.6 billion rm part of jibby. This is what I scared, people kept praising him too much, idolised him that it might going to hurt his image if he didn't noticed this soon and put a stop on it. People were worshipping mahathir after ge14. I spotted him in Sunway pyramid shortly after the election and he was being mobbed by people asking for selfies.. Where did you hear the sleeve folding adage from? It’s quite interesting and I’d like to read more about it and portraying that image if you can find a source.. Yeah got ya, lead by example basically!. I called this move the ‘reverse Burberry’. I understand the message behind his move, but honestly, I don't care if he's taking salary or forgoing a Merc, those aren't the real KPIs and the Anwar fanatics need to open their eyes and not fall in love too deeply.. >Even those public servants who don't care would feel the pressure if they carry on with their old ways.

Nah, they would just keep making new "kursus" to cover the shortfall. I mean I see dozens of Kastam/LHDN kursus letter in the office inbox, let alone the ones for my actual industry from other government departments.. This. It sends a message, and what a ballsy fucking message it is. Some people need to hear it.. Haha, you're kinda right, his car that he used the past week was the latest BMW 7 Series. So not to say he is downgrading by not using this S600. S600 Merc is Maybach, no? Pretty decent upgrade still. Imagine Malaysia in a free-market, S class cost 350k and the road will be filled with S classes lol.. Paul Tan called them Accordanas. Oi spit out my teh tarik. Yeah when Azmin and gang left the party, it was a total cleanup of PKR, removing every member that wouldn't support Anwar as PM candidate.. This. Public servants should empathize people who are already suffering economically.. But the car was bought previously, not by him. Letting a new car just sit in some car park is worse imo unless they give it to someone else to use it. Giving back a car is a lost. It depreciates as soon as you get the keys. Yeah dude literally just got elected and people are treating him like he can do no wrong. I am hopeful, but prepared to be disappointed too.. Given the government with BN (which I think is necessary) it's quite likely his policies won't be as liberal as this subreddit hopes.. But that's good politics. Politik matang.. Well, i think they bought it. Then when whoever using the car can outright buy it after 5 years. For a very good price. And since the po was created during PM9, this seems more likely.. Article links above say the BMW was loaned to him. No car assets declared under his name.. Imo a much better choice than a merc and audi.. Oi, nak masuk neraka ke?. Looking at GE-15 results, it has already begun.... This! We actually need to trim the fat so that discourage greedy people to run for office and open up opportunity and remove barrier for people who are genuinely passionate about humanitary/wellfare and societal good to join the gov. >I honestly have no issue for MPs getting paid for doing their job,

Absolutely agree.  It's when they abused their position. 

Najib was rumoured to  have a $1M+ power bill/yr.. paid for by the public.  Then buying Hermes bags for his hippo and get justified by "a guy can't buy his wife bags?"

Here's to hoping a golden age for Malaysia... His declared assets only about RM11 million...really not much..think USD. Not even $3m USD.

Meanwhile ...Ku Nan....got nearly RM 1 billion asset. A few millions to Ku Nan is just chump change.. Iirc Out of rm11 mil, rm10 mil of them are in terms of assets, like the 3(4?) houses he owns. So his only cash is under rm1 mil which is to me is still not considered as comfy living.. He also has all his pensions reinstated after his pardon. He is fine.. DT has a PR team, it consists of his sons, daughters, in-law & morons. 

No competent people would stay in a PR team where your opinions, advice & suggestions are ignored all the time.. Wait i thought it was Friendster 😂. come on buddy, tiktok is the best when i can see people do stupid stuffs and laugh about it while complaining why kids around us follow stupid trends!. I read it in an article when psychologist analyzing Obama's images from his first term presidential campaign. I cannot find the article anymore however you may find some interesting findings here: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2016.1201967](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2016.1201967) Although it wasn't fully on Obama, it tells a lot of the messages behind a picture and how deliberate one could be in staging the picture based on what they intended to project. One of another finding that I find it interesting is that people analyze Obama's watch. He wore a Tag Heuer diver watch that cost less than USD 600; a working class watch. As you guess it, it is also deliberate to showcase his working class image. You can read more on Obama here in  a study on Obama's pictures. [https://www.academia.edu/32225315/Image\_Control\_Image\_Control\_The\_Visual\_Rhetoric\_of\_President\_Obama](https://www.academia.edu/32225315/Image_Control_Image_Control_The_Visual_Rhetoric_of_President_Obama). The BMW was temporarily loaned by the owner of ~~Pantai Hospital~~ Pantai Bharu during campaign period. He has since returned it. 

The S600 is on lease so not using it means not having to renew the lease for the next 5 years. The official government car that he’ll be using is a Toyota Camry.

Edit: Toyota Camry [here](https://twitter.com/ravinp_69/status/1597193967841705989?s=46&t=BenPFKoJNQm9sTiO6GpFrg). Looks like managed to cancel to Mercedes order made by the previous government? Doesn’t sound like a lease to me. I don’t know what to believe anymore.. A fun hot hatch like the VW Golf GTI would also only cost around RM 120k which might mean a lot more people racing on the roads lol. This is the kind of justification which PAS and the other greedy fucks might use. It's good to see Anwar neuter these justifications.. Well, he could sell it and use the money for something else while going in for a new toyota camry?. It's a loss either way, at least if he doesn't use it the trade in value will be higher.

Also since this is the PMs car, Mercedes will probably just give back the full amount as a gesture of good will.

We aren't selling a car on mudah here.. Sunk cost fallacy on full display.. All my Mercedes, gone.. >Yeah dude literally just got elected and people are treating him like he can do no wrong.

Based on what I'm seeing, I don't think people are treating him like some infallible saint. People are starting to be a little proud for once, because they're seeing someone who fulfills the bare minimum of at least *trying to look like he gives a shit,* which is more than we could say for a lot of the previous guys.. I know, the “his” is just to refer the car he is driving not owned by him.. Saya atheist! Lmao. I agree with you but how can we attract competent and educated people to join politics other than money?. Oh this won't be easy, I'm sure MPs from both sides would rage if that was done. 

>Najib was rumoured to have a $1M+ power bill/yr.. paid for by the public. Then buying Hermes bags for his hippo and get justified by "a guy can't buy his wife bags?"

The wife said she spent a grand on her hair alone. Her Marie Antoinette moment.. Didnt know jibby had a pet hippo. You're right not much but more than most of us here do. He can eat nasi campur and order seafood, I can't.. I don't know about you, but I don't have that amount of money either. You can survive with far less than that.. Youre' right, forgot about that one. XD. Lenin and Stalin are the same too. Lenin with his everyday business shirt signifying that he is the leader of the common workers, and Stalin only smoking from a cheap tobacco pipe.. Thanks so much for the links! The first article was very interesting and has inspired me for my work.. Ah okay. Mind if I ask where did you find the info that the BMW was lent? I've always assumed it was Anwar's. >The official government car that he’ll be using is a Toyota Camry. 

Excellent car.. Well, it’s already been returned so a non-issue now. Looks like it’s a Camry from now on.. Honestly, I don’t know. I could give ideas, but they are all my thoughts. But I believe if money is no 1 attraction, then we will attract greedy people. But if so, we could also use money to make them work. The problem right now is even they don’t work, they still get their salary. And even they get even more money of they are corrupt.

Hence, I suggest their salary shouldn’t be decided by their own votes. Maybe make a system that MPs salary can be maximum 10x of the poorest household in his/her parliament only and minimum 3x minimum wage. Haha. See how poverty is solved withon a year only.. They are countries that marketed elected office as a humanitarian career path. Their education reflected this as a clear path, as well as not positioned as inferior to stem or business. The track are gearing the students towards finance, economy, administration, welfare, foreign relation etc. And for those are successfully elected into office they are given allowance, stipend and housing. They are mandated housing within a dense community amongst the constituent. This mandate by design allow/force them to better mingle with their constituent. They are mandated to take the public transport to their parlimentary/house meeting. They are mandated to send all their children to public school system. These forces them to feel the actual consequence of their work in legislation within their own life.

These at least would weed out greedy people. For greedy people, these are seen as a lot of strings attached to the office. But to people who really are on humanitarian mission, they not only not see this as obstacle, but they would be thankful for these mandate since these would actually better help them in their goal to help their community.. He just need to bring back Robert Kuok.. this guy will open up a lot of international business opportunities for Malaysia. 

But after how M screwed him.. doubt that will happen, which is sad.   The guy is a true patriot. You are wrong. Jibby is the Hippo's pet.. Alone probably. Not when we are in a sandwich generation, got dependents, debts, sudden need of cash and future-looking investments.

Again, of course can live but not as comfortable, at least to me.

In case of anwar, although his family semua dah besar, upkeeping his assets need money. He should be ok with rm900k, but he is 75 years old and who’s gonna pay for the upkeep of his assets when his time in this world is up? Again, lots of money compre with average peeps but not as comfy.. Anwar doesn't have a BMW. [He doesn't even have a car under his asset declaration](https://calonkeadilan.org/candidate/P063). 

His wife Wan Azizah has [three cars](https://calonkeadilan.org/candidate/P124) (2 x Myvi, 1 x Toyota Vellfire), his daughter Nurul Izzah has [a Proton](https://calonkeadilan.org/candidate/P044), according to their asset declarations.. He spoke about returning it [here](https://twitter.com/rashidyusoff11/status/1596504325508898818?s=46&t=ql-9YzD3rhvdKLBy4pcILQ)

If you read the comments you can see the owner of the BMW. My bad it’s a company called Pantai Bharu, not related to Pantai Hospital.. Toyota cars are cheaper (relatively) to buy and maintain/repair  plus more reliable. German cars are overengineered and cost a bomb to maintain and repair.. salary based on attendance rate. Not international just China. We need to diversify. In fact, we should be grabbing investors that are leaving China, not relying on Chinese investors. For example, we grovel and beg for them to buy Musang king. Guess what, Hainan in South China now has a musang king plantation already harvesting. They will cut you off when they don't need you anymore.. Thank you!. BMWs put plastic components between two turbochargers and guess why they fail often lol.. Coca Cola cut a deal with Kuok to get a foot hold into China.   I doubt very much Kuok contacts are isolated to only China..

>They will cut you off when they don't need you anymore

That's true for all the countries in the world, unsure why this is even being brought up..

80% of Asian sugar market and 10% of world sugar market. His contacts are definition not just isolated to China/ Asia. Caught in the high income high expenses trap and disappointed with life. I probably need some advice, but this is a rant more than anything else.

**Background**

I came from a B40 family (parents were lab techs or lowly government servants). Growing up, we knew the importance of money and I learnt how to save from my parents, who would boycott stuff for years even if the price increase was just 20-50 sens. They would also tally income and expenses every month manually in a ledger, and they started channeling some savings into equities etc. Of course, properties then were lower than they were now, and so my parents eventually had multiple properties. 

My siblings and I were also pushed very hard at school (they still believed that the best investment was education). We had to be it all. Best student, athlete, you name it. What that meant was that all of us were admitted to reputable foreign universities. Unfortunately, I did not get a full scholarship, unlike my siblings. That won't have been a problem if I stayed overseas, since could earn in a stronger currency. 

Fast forward, I met and married my wife who insisted on staying back in Malaysia and in a particular state. For love, I agreed. So yes, it was my decision. But that has brought my family into a financial stalemate. Even after 3 years, we do not have much savings due to very high expenses - something which I would not have imagined to be caught dead with - having being brought up in a low income household who constantly drilled it into my head that "it's not how much you earn, but how you manage it". Summary below.

**Income and Expenses rundown**

1. We take home about 28k MYR a month after taxes. I feel that in any other scenario, we would have been fairly well off. My parents had far less than that.
2. \-RM5k - I am still paying back a study loan which was in USD, and it will be another couple of years before I can finish it. Even a meager amount in USD is insane in MYR! 
3. \-RM 3k - There are now 2 children who incur some expenses every month.
4. \-RM 2k - As my wife insisted in staying in one state, and I had to work in another state to ensure I earn a high enough income to support my study loan and the family. But weekly the back and forth commute adds to expenses. I have half a mind now to stop going back until we have a financial buffer, but I really, really love being with my small children and my wife also does not agree. 
5. \-RM 7k - Wife's general expenses. Although my wife was brought up in an even poorer family (uneducated parents who could only work factory jobs or unemployed), they did not espouse the same thrifty values. This was extremely surprising for me - I wrongly assumed that all people from poor origins would know the value of saving, but she was brought up where her parents were content with their socio-economic situation, alright in living hand to mouth, "borrowed" money from relatives and friends to keep afloat, and didn't have the capacity or viewed an importance to save. I am surprised also because she has a postgraduate degree. Most of her other family members were also contented with earning low and I believe it this mentality is now ingrained in her. So while our expenses are through the roof, she still earns a meager salary and does not seem to be able to advance in position or pay. 
6. \-RM2k - to my wife's parents. She was brought up in a traditional setting where parents viewed children as potential bank accounts.
7. \-RM3k - have to rent 2 places at once since it's in 2 states. 
8. \-RM2k - Food. 
9. \-RM1k - Other general expenses like shopping.

So I am asking if anyone has any ideas:

1. What should I do with 3k leftover a month? What sort of investments (non-bumi) should I take right now? I'm 35 so the runway has significantly decreased. 
2. What expenses can I cut? You may assume that most of what my wife expenses is non-negotiable (although I recently had a chat with her about buying children unnecessary stuff every week and she seems receptive to reducing that). I am thinking of cutting the 2k weekly flights. I don't think I can decrease that by taking the train or bus as my job is intense and I have no energy to spend 5+ hours commuting. I have also recently reduced my rent to live in a room with room mates, even though I am 30+ years old. However, I cannot downgrade my wife's rent as both my child and her parents (they don't have property) with us. 

Generally, I am quite disappointed with life. Even if I were in a high income high expenses situation, I wished it were because I have a mortgage - I don't even have a house at 35! At least that would have been money put towards a possible asset. I know comparing is bad, but I also constantly envy my siblings as they have multiple properties overseas despite being younger than me and are living comfortable lives in fat cat jobs that typical ivy league graduates overseas have. They could come home for a holiday and make RM20k purchases on the spot while we are leisurely walking around the city without blinking. Who cares about FIRE when you're making half a million out of college, amirite?. The situation you're facing is exactly why I am not in a hurry to get a partner right now. Love is one thing, but if the financial literacy (and world view) between you two are incompatible, it will really bring you misery in a long run.

Like what others said, you married the wrong person. She might not need to do much at this moment. But one day if you lost the ability to work (touch wood), your wife will have to take on the whole expenses on her own. Will she able to take it on?

just my 2 cents. I seen a lot of my peers and family members experienced this so this post resonates with me.  


EDIT: Did you factor in insurance in your expenses? Doesnt seem like you have one?. You need to see where your wife is spending the money. 7000 a month is a lot for "wife expenses". If she buys household items then it might be more forgivable. FIND OUT where your wife is spending the money, the best case scenario would be that she is secretly saving up for you. Imagine paying RM2000 for her expenses, you would have 7k additional income to save/invest.. Those 2 children are gonna cost more than 3k soon. The sad truth of "Marrying the right person, you are complete. Marrying the wrong one, you are finished".



As other commenter says. It doesn't matter if your income was 28k or 38k. It's the mindset on financial responsibility that's important. If you can't convince your wife onto the same mindset, everything is pointless.


You have 3 choices:

1. Accept your situation and coast through life. 10-20-30 years down the road, you will still be in the same situation. And worse, you'll then need to rely on your children for your retirement. Is this the burden you wanted for your children?


2. Re-explain to her on the future planning. But now you need to be firm. Take over finances and allocate a more reasonable budget for your wife & parents in law. Be firm.


3. More extreme method, split your finances. Let her cover her own allowances and parents in laws. Will this break your family apart? Maybe. But if you love your children, this might be a burden you should shoulder. Prioritise what's the best for your children's future.. I stopped reading halfway. TALK WITH YOUR WIFE!! Make a budget and expenses and show it to her. And plan your next step with how she reacts. I love my husband and in no way I will let him struggle hard. We are a team and we need to work on it together. See your parents, they are very involved as team.
Edit: Make budget, expenses, retire plan, saving plan and stick to it.. Bro pls la. Move your wife and kids near you and stay with them. Feel sad reading this man and that you have to have share a room with roommates at 35 despite making 28k. Just put your foot down and start cutting costs drastically. Not easy because she’s your wife but I guess you have to somehow persuade her. 

With saving one place rent, commute and cutting down on the 7k you give her, I think can push your savings to 10k a month minimum.. You married the wrong person.

Or to be blunt, probably a gold digger.

She earning peasant salary while her expenses and expenses due to her takes up more than half of ur pay? Red flag. 

You have to support her parents? Red flag. 

Ask her to pay for her own expenses. You are not her ATM. Is time for u to put your foot down.. Hi Op. I’m sorry that things did not go as planned and I can sense that you are frustrated. I’d like you to know op that I was that wife. Wasting my husband’s time, money, and effort a way. I quit a 5 figure income because of stress, and keep on shopping like I didn’t. Anyway op, my husband had a talk with me and spread out a ledger. 

We made a financial goal plan together to clear off my debt first. I made major life changes, turned into minimalism (not like those aesthetic ppl in Youtube, just having less stuff & buy in bulk etc). 

I may be a graduate, a working adult, but money management is a separate thing to learn. We bought books and read abt house flipping, savings, four hour work week etc. Basically he tried to change my random fashion, coffee hopping, duck scarves shopping into something more fun. It was a long journey a lot of heartache, but damn I learned so much. Took abt 5 years to finally save money and invest. 

Cook with her, do cheaper activities (hiking, yoga, home arts), get an insurance agent or any finance bros to explain to her abt the reality and what is out there, buy books abt finance and retirement and read together. 

I wish you only the best. The rut isn’t forever.. Why would you agree to all these demands at the first place? I mean paying for your children' expenses that I could understand.

But her parents'? She should support her own family, not you. I can only think that the situation would improve when you pay off your student loan; have your wife cut down her unnecessary expenses; get a divorce; or you die/run away.

Man I would run away like tonight.. haven't divorced yet, she is already robbing the 50% 😅. Interesting for me to come across this post, as i just got dumped by my-ex simply because she viewed me as not able to provide the luxuries in life. 
Currently my (32.M) mthly salary is of 9.8k while she's (33.FM) with 8k. 

Some parts of me felt betrayed as i stayed with her while she struggled to move up in life - while I've been stagnant in my own career, worrying bout her. And spent ungodly amount of my own money trying to feed her by eating out nice foods (avg rm300-400 per dinner). And ungodly amount of grabfood during mco for her. 

Simply put, i may have dodged a bullet in the end as she indirectly admitted she's a gold digger. 

Just gonna remain single for now and focus on self-love and of course recalibrate my finances for my own future. 

Sorry my comment is not helping, but just sharing my sentiments. Good luck OP. This is my 2-sen, feel free to tell me to fuck off :)

It doesn't matter how high your income is... one would usually be caught in this trap regardless.

Let's say suddenly your take home income increased from 28K to 38K. Your expenses would automatically increase anyway.

Of course I am not in your situation where huge chunks of $ have to go to parents and out of state spouse.

But your wife and her parents don't seem to be too understanding unfortunately.

I make a LOT LESS than you, but I think I have a much more financially comfortable life than you do.. I see a lot of comments have addressed the obvious. I'd like to point out you have a huge privilege many people who came from B40 backgrounds don't, parents who have lived with less and still managed to save.

My suggestion is to save every receipt for a month. Don't control your wife yet, just ask her to save every receipt and then sit down and key in the detailed expenses in an excel sheet. Review where the spending is really going and then use your parents as 

1) advisors on where you can consider cutting spending

2) how to talk to your wife about getting on the same page as a couple

of course, some parents might not be the most uh PC about this so whether you include both, just the most rational one or whatever is for you to decide. You can always just do (1) and see what feedback they give. 

When our expenses ballooned recently (SO has subsidiary cards of my CC), my SO got defensive when I told her we had to cut costs. When I brought it up again a few days later, I instead talked about what I'd like to do with her, (in my case, extravagant super lux honeymoon) for you it could be something like buying a house together. When I approached it this way, she had something to look forward to and started volunteering which expenses she could cut out so we can save more.  

The first approach felt like it was a her problem, the second approach was a goal we are aiming for together.. This is mostly a relationship issue from mismanagement of expectations. Your financial situation is just a byproduct of that. So talk about that instead of talking about numbers with your wife and get your priorities aligned first before anything. Good luck going forward.. RM3k for just 2 children??? Oh man after reading this i dont i think i want to start a family anytime soon. Your wife's is taking s over 10k-15k of your total income..that is crazy, it's time to sit down and have a serious discussion about money and moving forward.

Yori kids expenses will continue to increase, even if u send them to gov school. 

Have a serious discussion about moving your family to your place of work, give your wife a choice, it's either that or cut down general expenses and payment to parents

At 28k a month u are in T20 bracket but living like M40. Bruh, 28k take home and you're disappointed in life? You should be disappointed in the choices you've made. Even though it could be argued that a lot of things were circumstantial and whether we have free will to begin with, you've made a lot of choices that landed yourself where you are today. You say you know the importance of money but it doesn't seem like you're that great at budgeting to begin with. 

You could convince your family to move closer to where you work but since you've positioned everything your wife demands for as a non-negotiable, I'm not sure what you can do apart from making another 10k lol.

Technically you can afford mortgage with the remaining 3k, but not all mortgages are good investments anyway.. Echoing everyone else, your wife's expenses need to be cut. But I think the way you should approach it is as a team. There is a budgeting app called YNAB that just recently released a partners version. You and your wife know the monthly incoming, now it's time for you to decide collectively where each of those ringgits will go using the app as a tool. Hopefully, by using the app and making those decisions up front, she'll be better at controlling her expenses.. Dude, I hate to be blunt but you're a doormat. That's what I am learning about you from this entire post and your replies.

Your income before taxes is probably around RM33-35k. That puts you into the top 2-3% of households in Malaysia. 

Your wife at best sees you as an ATM card, as a means to an end.

What on god's earth is she spending RM7k on in personal expenses A MONTH? 

Do you understand that RM7k gross salary puts a household firmly in the M40 bracket???

Why do you need to kowtow to her every whim? Are you a simp? 

You say she has financial issues, no it is you that has them. You gotta step up, be a man, and tell her what's what. 

RM7k personal expenses for your wife? Fuck no, RM7k expenses for an entire family of 4 a month is plenty enough (excluding rent / loans). 

RM2k to her parents? Fuck no even more. You don't pay for that shit.

Living in separate states / separate homes? Dude, are you even a man? What reason does your wife have to choose to stay away? 

Financial issues are the least of your worries here, your relationship seems weak and one sided. You sure your wife doesn't have a proper man on the side? 

And finally, what the hell are you even teaching your kids man? 

Be a man, that's my only advice. 

P.S. You can start by no levelling any blame at your wife's parents.. Hi OP. My 2 cents is that this is less a financial issue but rather a relationship issue. I know you posted here to get financial advice though so feel free not to read further.

But if you do, could i suggest the following. You mentioned you would like to have some savings. But maybe take it further. 

Work out what you need that savinga for, whether it is for a rainy day, whether it is for your kids education, to buy a house, etc etc. 

Then work out how much you really need for each and then calculate backwards to show how much you would need now (including if you regularly invest in non risky assets). Do take into account inflation too.

Once you have that, then it becomes the starting point for a conversation with your wife because you have clear data points because it is not just about "we are spending too much" but rather "if we want to svae xx amount for xx reasons, this is what we need to set aside every month and this is the remainder for spending. What trade offs do we need to make to achieve these xx saving goals for OUR family"

Know its easier said then done but hope this helps.

Oh and i would suggest you start to keep some savings and spending for yourself. Perhaps this year and the next, the economy is bad and there was 'no increment' and 'no bonus' wink wink or even a reduction in salary wink wink wink. Does your wife have the breakdown of rm7k monthly expenses? If not, I think you should start with that. Slowly talk to her about cutting down some of her expenses. Tell her all of that saving is for the children's future. Try to put the financial data into an Excel worksheet or something to convince her.. So, your real-problem is human-relation/mentality-problem (not financial, pls don't desperately fall into investment scam), this problem is kinda common and widespread. 

Take some sugars, let us understand and try to get a resolution by digging into your wife's side mentality first. 

'Take it for granted' this is the root of the problem, doesn't matter the person is a beggar or billionaire, you will be surprised most of the world may have such mentality (human's nature, we enjoy free stuffs). University does not really teach you to be a better human. 

Communication and compromises have to be made to solve the 'take it for granted' mentality, we are humans with family and love our families. You don't cut-off your family to fix the problem (no bullshit). 

I will write more later, if you're interested in communication-solutions.. You have 7K for wife's expenses and 2K for wife's parents. That's 9K coming out of your pocket every month! Even if your wife's parents' money is non-negotiable (I still think it's high and wonder if your wife is an only child supporting her parents), your wife's expenses itself is exorbitant. List down everything she's buying, see if what she's buying is really needed. Soon enough you'll see that the non-negotiables are actually negotiable.. Can't stress enough the importance of finding the right partner who shares similar financial values.. I think your main issue is to maintain 3 households( you, wife and child, wife parents). If you move your wife and children to your place it could consolidated a lot of the spendings like rent and food.

However the main thing is to spend more time with your children. Because if you don't instill good financial value in them NOW twenty years down the road you are dealing with 3 person with zero clue about spending.

Less traveling for you, more family time...

I still wonders what sort of beauty regime in "cheaper state" can cost up to 7k per month..... Son, asking for advice on what to do with the 3k you have left is like putting a band-aid on an axe wound.

Stop. The. Bleeding. Now.. Hey OP, just curious. What’s stopping you from personally controlling her expenses and making the decisions on where your family lives (not in a toxic way but in a we need to work together for a brighter future kinda perspective)? 

1) Only allow your spouse access to a fixed monthly expense budget. If your spouse is working and is spending within her income, establish fixed contributions (e.g 3k has to be transferred to shared savings every month (could be a split of retirement, fun money and child education), have to chip in for the rentals, groceries etc..). 
2) Firmly let your spouse know that you should be living together as a family (no good reason not to, parents or lifestyle are not good enough reasons to be honest as it will benefit both your mental stability, financials and the upbringing of your children)
3) Is your spouse working at all? If she is, parents pocket money should be fully footed by her. It’s her parents after all, you should be spoiling your parents instead.
4) Draw a picture to your wife in detail the outcome of current spending habits, e.g no money for children’s education, no retirement money etc… Paint a scary picture, find some real world examples. 
5) From your responses it seems that you are not willing to challenge your spouse and parents in law especially in terms of financials and child upbringing. I think it’s time for you to stand up for yourself and what you believe is right, challenge their methods in a civil and loving manner, use yourself and your family as good examples etc… and most importantly it’s your children and your money you should have a say in what happens to them (as long as it’s for the benefit of your kids and your health) 
6) In my personal opinion, this may be the most important. Please please please have a heart to heart with you wife on how this is negatively affecting you. And please for the love of god do not downplay any part of it. A good spouse should be more concerned about your health and your children’s future over spending money no ifs ands of buts. 


Sincerely good luck OP, hope you can turn this around without too much bloodshed and soured relationships. More importantly please remember that your opinion matters(more so in this context), children need a father figure in their lives and your mental health is important too. Better to challenge them and cause discomfort and strain on the relationship than being constantly unhappy and potentially having suicidal thoughts.. JFC, this is why I constantly tell my surrounding people to master their own emotions, to always maintain a habit of think rationally and stay realistic regardless of the topics, which today's people failed consistently for some reason. Love can be poisoning and unsustainable if you act upon it without consider much of the consequences.

This entire situation is not caused by the insufficient income earnings or whatsoever, but it is because the distribution is so uneven in the first place. You all need to sit down, take a long talk about the future and reshuffle the entire expenses then set your priorities straight. Let's be real: in the future you eventually need to give the best education for your children, having this kind of expenses and saving distribution is very, very concerning. I don't consider myself as an expert in saving monies **but the fact that I feel horrified by the information you given speaks a lot of the absurdity**. 

You both are adults now, I think it's time for a talk, a long one especially. If you all intend to walk through life together, side by side, you guys need to talk.. I am mad as hell. How can 28k is not enough? 😭 But yeah man, just start talking to your wife about her spending and stop funding her family for god sake.. have you try to communicate to your wife and ask what her expenses is to the point that its taking up 1/4 of your income,youre the main breadwinner of your family, COMMUNICATE and try to lower your expenses to your wife, dont really wanna comment about your relationship with your wife but try start talking with her first and find out whats going on with that expenses.

if you can manage to cut down atleast 3-4k from its already good enough imo, youre a husband you should be atleast strict about the financial need of your wife.. Not to be judgemental but how is she spending 7k per month? That is insane.
Buying stuff for children should fall under children expenses. Is she just going out to spend everyday or what? 2k to her parents is also questionable, even more so when it's you that is paying, I feel as if those 2k should fall under wife's expenses as well no?
I'd generally give her 4k including the money for her parents, totalling up to you having 8k every month in saving.. My husband was bought up in the same environment as your wife. He literally had no financial literacy nor future planning and was content with living from pay check to pay check. 

Mind you, he earns more than I do, and I earn more than 2x of what your wife spends a month. We’re supposedly well within the T10 based on the latest salary categorisation. Imagine spending so much monthly on things that will break down in a few years instead or investing in your future retirement.

He’s much better now. We spoke alot about finances after having a kid, and he has attempted to cut down on spending. He still spends on alot of ‘man toys’ but atleast he has way more savings in his bank account now than before. I did tell him to think beyond the temporary happiness that he feels from buying stuff he don’t need every month just to deplete his bank account and I think it worked?  We’re also able to afford a couple of properties after some financial adjustment. 

Personally, I feel RM7k is abit too much money to be spent each month. Maybe try asking your wife to itemise her monthly expenses and get her to Marie Kondo her spending style? Sometimes people aren’t aware of how much they spend unnecessarily until they see it itemised out in front of them.. 

If I were in your shoes, I would try the following 

1. Take 1-2 months leave from my work ;
2. Tell my wife I have lost my job and will be moving back home;
3. Start paying for everything but cancel her cc to track expenses;

The idea here is to see when income (theoretically) dries up, how much can the family really cut down on expenses in order to survive. Abit like a fire drill but everyone else doesnt know.

Silly suggestion. Feel free to ignore. kek. why does your wife sound sabahan?. Many have already mentioned about your wife, and at least one has suggested advancing your career which I have no doubt you are trying to already do. So let me offer my 2 cents on rent, food, and travel

On travel, are you flying back and forth? If so, consider driving occasionally as it is far cheaper. Whenever I drive to and fro between KL and JB, the total cost for petrol and toll is around RM160 per return trip. Just bear in mind that it takes more time and energy, but that's the price to pay. 

Rental, RM3k a month is high. Consider renting a room for yourself if you have not already done so. I don't know how much your wife's rental is, but I assume it's for a house with the kids around. You can also consider at least buying a home at her state, then at least the money goes into property from which you can recover next time when you sell it. 

As for food, honestly RM2k is a lot, it most definitely can be cut down. When I bought my own house, I had to cut down on food and just eat the simplest home-cooked meals. Just rice, some eggs, and veggies for the weekdays. I have no mood for a tasty meal on weekdays anyway as I'm on autopilot slogging through work. Weekends are when I allow myself a bit more pleasure in life by buying some nicer ingredients to cook and eat at home, sometimes going out too. 

Note that I'm only suggesting steps pertaining to costs that affect, and can be controlled, by you only. Just keep all the savings quiet from your wife.. Perhaps swapping wife and child expenses would be somewhat better. There OP. You have a clear mind and listed down the main problem already. 

What I think you could do:

1. Talk to your wife. As the root of the issue is her spending habit. Cut that down and save a few k more for other purposes.

2. Prioritize the investment first. Set some goal, for example, 8k per month and throw it into a fixed monthly investment or saving account (with or without your wife knowledge). Just tell your wife this is the first thing that you should deduct and the 20k is all you have for now. 20k is definitely enough for most family. 

3. Cut the unnecessary expenses. Is there a way to save on rent? As you work without your family in other state, maybe rent a smaller house for few hundred to a thousand? Ask your wife to cook more? 

4. 2k to wife parents? I’m giving only to my parents 1k and their groceries even I earning 20k alone! I won’t be giving my in law any money tbh. Don’t your in law have other children or son? Just support their monthly groceries if you want. 2k is too much. 

5. Open another bank account without your wife knowledge and put money inside. Declare to your wife and family that you earn lesser now. Save the remaining for other healthier purposes like deposit for house or share investment. 

That’s all about it man. Don’t be disappoint in life because of this. You know the problem, and if the root cause doesn’t change, just change the surrounding on the root cause.. You are a sweet man. There are going to be some difficult conversations ahead. I wish you guys the best. 💜. There has to be some compromise. Mayb she and ur children can move to the state you are working. That way no need to spend on flights and additional rent. Can put downpayment on a house. 7k spending on herself is high if u are already paying for all else. Perhaps can sit down n discuss where the big leak on your expenses. All the best.. Hey OP, you came for financial advice and you got bashed. Just wanted to say, kudos for making the effort, please don't let the negativity get to you, and stay strong for yourself, your family, and your future.

(That being said, not sure how you thought you could write up this post while being so vague about the biggest expense you have and not expect to get a scolding from the community. Not doubting that 7k is an unreasonable expense but without some transparency into how that is broken down, everyone is left to imagine all sorts of wild things.)

\- Food - You work in senior management, right? So... it wouldn't be unreasonable to... look at your employment contract or speak to HR about entertainment allowances to help offset some meals should you dine out? And/or learn to cook simple, healthy meals for yourself, with local ingredients.

\- Weekly flights - 2k sounds a lot, I'm assuming you're the one flying back and maybe this includes grab fares or something. Since it's domestic, maybe take advantage of sale periods and buy further ahead of time.

\- Rent - 3k for two places doesn't sound too bad honestly. Please don't rent a dinky room somewhere and sacrifice your peace of mind.

\- The kids - What's your plan for them in the future? Do you want an overseas education of them? Do you think you'd be able to support their education, or imagine that they'd also take on an education loan like you did, thus repeating your cycle of debt? If I were you, I'd do the math on how much it'll take to support the kids until undergrad and have a discussion with my wife about that number, and what it'll take for both of you as their parents to get them there.

Wishing you all the best in life, buddy. It's never too late to get back on the horse.. Hello OP, was just browsing through and saw your post. Really feel for you, my life situation is quite different to yours but for many reasons I just feel like I can identify in quite a few things you are saying. I have seen similar things play out with my parents and other relatives. In terms of technical financial ideas I don't have anything anyone else hasn't already said but I do have a few points of reflection that might be able to give you some thoughts like the ones below.

1. Many people from lower income situations (regardless of race) can get into problems with personal expense management when they get into a higher earning situation. Part of it is because they are "compensating" for the time they could not have what they wished for. From your wife's point of view, she now has a husband that is 'a high flyer', so maybe a lot of her financial discipline she had when poorer has been released and that is probably linked to your issues. To get this under control, you need to get your wife to wake-up and realise that while things are now very good (from an income point of view) it doesn't mean that all your dreams can come true at the same time. Some people might even go to counseling (I know this is still a taboo topic in Malaysia) but this can be one way of confronting any hidden thinking and decision making processes that come from your wife's early days. People are a lot more complicated than we sometimes think. It is probably linked to habits as well, and people sometimes think they cannot change that. If this is the case going through a book / Audiobook like James Clear's Atomic Habits might help (looks like she is quite intellectual as you said so this approach may work). If you can talk to her you need to work on this as you already know.

2. Is it possible that your wife's spending patterns will drop if she stops going to work? As you have said she isn't in a high paying job, but by going to work she might be outside more, going shopping more, going to eat more, buying more things for the kids to compensate for not being at home, maybe if she was at home there just removes a need for her to spend so much?Maybe she does have habits that are good (like cooking etc) that will save money when you change the environment she operates in. Same for you as well, will changing your environment with work change your spending habits (for sure it will if you are not staying remote from family for instance), and maybe you will actually be happier? Things to think about and it affects many high end professionals more than your know. 

3. From an earnings standpoint you are doing well, you would be doing well even in an overseas country pay wise. Unfortunately expenditure wise you would also be on the high side in some overseas countries outside of Malaysia so you are not getting ahead financially as you should be. But, with family in Malaysia and effectively on an overseas salary the potential is always there for you to be in a very good financial position. Many Malaysian expats would actually love to be in your shoes (minus the obvious problems with travel and partners expenditure of course). You've done the hard work, now just got to convert it to push you forwards.

4. Have you optimised your tax position with your pay and student loan situation? You didn't say if you were being paid in Ringgit or in overseas currency, but if you are being paid overseas, have a good look at whether you can restructure the payment of your student loan so that it is more being paid out of your net earnings completely in that country. Helps if the tex rules make it worthwhile, so do ask around and get professional advice here.

5. We are likely going into a global situation where economic growth will slow, loans become more expensive and inflation hits harder and harder. Start looking at your loans and cut off anything optional now, sell off expensive cars or things on a loan that will not appreciate in the future and ride it out. Tough times tough choices.

6. Own a European car? Euro cars (or at least the ones we aspire to in Malaysia) are always a maintanence issue when they get old enough and when stuck in the heat. Never good for maintenance costs, unless you are your own mechanic (and I'm assuming you just don't have time for that). If you have to get an older car to save money think of getting something safe, but probably non-European and with good fuel economy to cut down on maintenance costs. 

7. Not the first thing you will think about at this time but take care of yourself and don't get sick or injured. If you do at this point it gets ugly. Much uglier than however it turns out any other way.

8. Sometimes there are just no silver bullet solutions. You need to make small changes and over time they add up and count. Getting into this habit with controlling spending and saving money is very powerful.

9. I get from your posts and comments that you seem to be a pretty agreeable and what people would say is a nice guy. Remember that with this character, sometimes to do the best for our loved ones and family long term we have to forget who we are in the short term, be a bit stricter and harsher in order to be the best we can be in the long term.

All the best. You have a very bright future ahead of you don't let your times when you are at your lowest. Make a plan and make those changes, however small, one at a time. Make steady changes, give it some time and you will get there.. I don't have any financial advice for you, but I have a little encouragement for you and maybe a suggestion to view things in a better lens. You have 2 children, a wife, parents, siblings and most importantly and i know i'm assuming here, health. A lot of people don't. Your monthly home income seems alright. I think tho you can still try to find solutions to the problem you think you have right now, it's best to view it at a more positive tone. It sounds like you are not happy and miserable when i can tell you i would trade my bank savings to be able to live your life. Your siblings have a different path in life. You as well. Be the best dad you can and that means being truly happy. Find happiness not in your success in material and money, but in something that is unshakeable. Such as personality, a good human being, or just an all around great dad / husband to your family. 

My siblings both earn way more than me too. My younger one works abroad and gets paid 3X more than i do. So i know the feeling. But i love my siblings and i am genuinely happy for them. I also know my own life has its course. And i dont want to chase money or materials tho i will work hard for it. I just want to live 1 day at a time. Because i want to make sure my health is still ok. Hope that helps you navigate through your problems in a lighter way. Cheers.. I would suggest a few thing and see if you could make it work.

1.) Managing your expenses

Nobody like to be micromanaged and it would be hard to limit your wife's spending just by her discipline. Going through her spending is helpful to check if she really need to spend all of that 7k per month. On managing your wife's or rather your family's expenses, I would suggest give her a lump sum RM10k and ask her to manage for the following:
a.) Rent at your children's place
b.) Spending for the children and family 
c.) Her parent's spending (the 2k)
d.) Her spending

Be mindful that the T20 starts from 10k for most state in Malaysia. I'm sure 10k is more than enough. 

2.) Save as much as possible and secure your funds

Get into some kind of commitment for force saving. For example monthly contribution to SSPN for your kids, buy property, unit trust or stocks. In this case, when your wife demand more money, you could make the excuse that you do not have cash as it is all tied up in your property and investment. Touch wood in case your wife's parents need medical treatment, it's easier to admit them into government hospital instead of cutthroat private hospital when you don't have cash sitting in your bank account.

As others had mentioned, making your wife understand the goal is important. For example you might want to save for your kids education overseas or buying a property for a place you could truly called home or bring your kids to travel once every year etc.

3.) Prepare for your retirement

I don't mean to induce anxiety in you but to serve this as a wake up call. I hope you have your EPF is loaded enough to somewhat cover you and your wife's retirement. If not you should seriously start to look into this and ramp up your saving. Check how long does it takes to reach FI and how much you need to save [here](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) 

If you need to spend half your current salary (14k) per month after retirement, you'll need to save half of your salary (14k) for 16 yrs (when you're age 51) until you can retire with FI, this is without considering EPF of course.

4.) Increase your spending

You must equipped with some special skill to make people pay you over 400k per year. Leverage on your knowledge and skill and try to earn additional stream of income, most probably from 

a.) providing consulting service
b.) business ventures with you having smaller or no capital contribution but offering your expertises
c.) leveraging on your professional license is you have any. I think its not money problem... its wife problem. If you dont fix your wife, you're gonna have a bad time in future. When negotiating a cut down of expenses, don’t forget that lifestyle readjustments take time because habits take time to develop. If you want to keep your marriage and family, negotiate steadily but softly. 

Also, you may want to consider broaching some of these matters with a challenge and a what if. 

what if I lost my job? Can you pick up the slack while
I cared for kids? what if i had trauma and can’t work for awhile? how about a challenge that you can live on 2k a month instead of 7? how prepared are you to go back into poverty? 

Also, you need to be prepared to face some fire. both of you should see a financial planner then you put your foot down and hopefully both conclude that “we are saving 6k a month, 3 from me, 3 from your current expenses.. Maybe it is time to pull out the "If you love me" card. Tell your wife, if you love me can you please cut down your spending so that I at least I don't have to share room with other people?. Cut the 2k u give her parents and tell her if she wants to give her parents money take it out of the 7k. You kill two birds with one stone; reduce her spending by 2k and saved yourself 2k. Eventually your student loan will be paid off and you will have alot more breathing room and less stress. Obviously the location thing should be sorted as well if u explain to her the stress you are going through because of the traveling and staying together will help you both emotionally AND financially.. This post is very sad and I keep coming to see your replies. Not much thing to be said about financial recommendations since others have offered their insights. You are disappointed with life, and at this point you knew already what significantly contributes to that disappointment. 

Things are really complicated when it involves the person we love, and more so when children are added into the scene.

One thing I noticed, you send money to her parents but i see none for your parents. You mentioned about how your parents educated your siblings to bring out the potential to the highest and they did a good job educating you how to manage money. I wonder if they are still alive. 

You seem to care for your family a lot, but financially one-sided. You give them comfort even though you have to sacrifice yours, mentally, physically and financially. I don't see anything related to your entertainment from the expenditure breakdown. You are a great father and husband, and thank you for that.

Therefore for you to be willingly burdened with all these, I assume your wife must have her fair share of sacrifice too not in financial matters like taking care of the children and the house, and giving you the love you deserve. Hopefully things will be well for you after this.. Moral of the story: that bussy be deadass good to fck over a man's potential like that.. You're about to get r/relationships 'd. After reading all the replies and comments, i think the best way to move forward for you family is for your wife to note down all her expenses. I use money manager to track every RM and it has open my eyes to all the big expenses in my life. You should really get her to note down everything being spent and maybe you do it together with her as form of encouragement and support. It will help her see where the biggest expenses are and at least give her a direction to focus her effort. 

Since you're looking for advice, I'm just going to throw this out there....I'm sure you have talked to her a lot about personal finance but I think another good way to get her to learn is if you have her follow some PF accounts on IG or FB. I've personally learned a lot over the years...the information is bite sized so they're easy to understand and remember (at least for me).

The hard truth needs to be spoken to your wife. If you continue living life this, you will never be able to set up your family for success. If you buy a house, you'll be stuck paying it off for 30 years instead of being able to settle it 10-15 years earlier with your savings. 

Sorry to sound harsh but unfortunately that's the reality of it.  Good luck OP. So sorry you are in this situation - I can’t really relate because my bf would never fund my lifestyle (you give your wife 7k a month wow) and we split our expenses 50/50 via Splitwise (I know very unAsian and unromantic) because he thinks that’s fair and tbf we have gotten used to it lol. Maybe get your wife to log her day to day spending (for the household etc. in Splitwise so you can have a look and where’s she’s spending the money? Also recommend having her read Psychology of Money, great book and helps shift the way you would typically think about money. Money values are really the result of upbringing so I feel bad for you and your wife, I also grew up poor and thus had a strong urge to make money (I currently work abroad away from family also because of the higher income) whereas my bf grew up very comfortable and is from a well to do family but his parents used to scare him saying he will become homeless if he doesn’t work hard so he’s very frugal and careful with money. We are both working towards achieving FIRE / probably with 0-1 kids and it does make one feel way more secure having a partner with similar life goals and financial values. Also recommend reading Mr. Money Mustache or listening to FIRE podcasts just to slowly guide your wife towards changing her mindset and spending less. I give my mum monthly allowance too so I see why that might be harder to be cut but again the 7k might be a good place to start or you might consider buying a house and spending part of that 3k on a mortgage for your wife and kids to live in (since they are not keen on moving anyway and presumably live in a cheaper state? I am guessing you work in KL?). Good luck!. After reading half the comments here, despite most people have good intentions but kinda harsh… I think OP really love his wife and family and probably that’s why he’s trying to not blame his wife in the 7k spending by shifting the blame to her upbringing… I think OP should have a calm discussion and conversation with the wife on what you both want to have financially in future… I feel like you both are not on the same page (despite the personal upbringing or money spending habit).  Then probably slowly cut down the spending? Instead of going from 7 to 2k, maybe to 5k first? Then gradually “train” her into spending less monthly on her stuff. 

Either way, if your wife is an understanding person (again despite her spending habits), if you can convince her that by having the same financial goals (buying property/savings for retirement), then it can be solved gradually. 

Another thing is, if you had agreed to move back to Msia due to commitment to your wife, then don’t regret it. As this will create unnecessary tension between you two. Instead of thinking what you could’ve did, why not think what you can do now to improve your distance situation.

Just my 2 cents

EDIT: I saw some comments recommending to educate the wife financially, I’m going to say that is probably very difficult,that’s why I said to paint a picture of a financial goals together will be easier for her to grasp the concept. If one thing I learn in marriage… do not try to educate directly, most of the time won’t work. 🤣. The big red flags are the weekly flights (did you purchase everything last minute? 2k is a bit high for weekly flights for a month) and the appalling amount of "wife expenses". With a 28k/month household, you should be able to get your hands on a few properties at this point instead of renting. The 2k cut to be siphoned to your in-laws should be taken out directly from the "wife expenses". Your wife must be living like royalty with 7k of expenses per month. As someone just said, it's RM230 per day consistently for a WHOLE DAMN MONTH - I would have an easier time literally burning the money than finding something to spend it on. 

There are families out there with HALF the amount of your total household income who are able to lead a way more financially comfortable life than this. 28k is nothing to sneeze at. You can't possibly expect anyone to take this seriously and recommend some enlightened financial-guru-y tips when both of you are raking in that much income per month while being the exact opposite of frugal.

Both of you really need to start documenting expenses IN DETAIL and categorizing them in excel sheets now (I have a pretty complete automated macro-enabled template, if you're interested, you can DM). Once you start the process of recording every expense, even little ones, you'll get very self-conscious of the astronomical amount of wastage and get somewhat discouraged from spending extravagantly down the road.. Lmao you don't have a finance problem, you have a wife problem. Sorry to be blunt but you married a gold-digging leech and she and her family are sucking up all your money. She's just stepping all over you and you're letting her do it. Like you said, you don't even own any real assets because it's all going towards her upkeep including the 3k in travel expenses between your two rented homes which is sad enough as it is but you're also giving her 7k in shopping money even though she has a job and is highly educated.. Yo WTF? 7k per month for your wife??! And you guys earned 28k per month. This is a perfect example of "20k salary still not enough if..." 

Like others said, you really need to talk with your wife about her spending habits. Even if you still want to finance her parents (2k) as long as you she can reduce her spending to at least half it's good enough for the time being. Come live with you, cannot. 
Decrease spending, cannot. 

I’m sorry but separation would probably be the only good option. Focus on giving money for your kids spending and education. Up to 30k a month and still having this kind of trouble, really cannot brain. 

All in all, goodluck sir.. Things people do for love.. I grew up poor just like you and learned the same values. And my wife is exactly just like your wife. I constantly have conversations and discussions with her regarding savings and being thrift with money. Two weeks later, and she's back to her old thoughtless spending. Wash and repeat. Over the years, I've kind of sarcastically viewed this behaviour to being, 

A) wah! Got money! Spend! spend! spend!
B) it's not my hard earned money, so I don't know how to appreciate it! Spend! Spend! Spend! Still got more right!?
C) what is being thrift? I've never had to do that before, so troublesome, just spend! Spend! Spend!

I tell you, sometimes I have no balance from my salary and it's slowly eating up my savings.

To change and install a new understanding and behavioural concept to someone who grew up not knowing it, is quite honestly very hard. But not impossible. Just have to keep at it and put it to practice. When we go shopping for groceries, if I think something isn't worth it, I'll pick up a cheaper option. Small things like this has an impact to slowly get her to follow suit... Good luck my friend.. Kudos to you for having the strength and mental capacity to go through all that. Salut. Many husbands are trapped just like you.. Dear OP, the most important question to ask yourselves is: are u happy. If u are happy, then just continue with wat u are doin.. I suppose you can see how supportive your wife will be if you tell her that your job is affected by the economic downturn and your pay just got slashed 10%. If she agrees to reduce 10% of all expenses then you can use that to save towards a down payment for your house. It’s not nice to lie, but you need to think for the greater good. At this rate you will never be able to retire.. Wife sounds like a burden 🤔. I'm gona refrain from commenting on your relationship just because you are seeking purely financial advice and not relationship advice. 

You perhaps need to focus on earning more. Crazy? I know. But I realize a lot of financial advice is always around cutting back/saving and never on diversifying your income. 

See if you can fight for a better role or shift companies. Your take home pay should be increasing if you move jobs. If you can save up for 12 months (36k) you should be able to fund a businesses. You can secure loans as well with your income pretty easily. Something to look at perhaps.

You can cut back yes, but maybe temporarily to arm up and then deploy into other businesses that can do 2 things : 1. Buy back your time 2. Increase your MRR. 

Again. These are alternatives to having a frank discussion with your wife about cutting back expenditure. As someone who grew up in a very similar situation to you, I understand that sometimes coming from a place of lack can have the opposite effect from the scarcity mindset one may assume.. Bro ive posted my advice on the financial part of things.

But I'll post one more time cos there has been too much shit from many of the other post.

Ppl whom are not in your marriage shouldnt be posting as if they know your life based on a couple of paragraphs 🤣

So ignore the nastiness and the 'I know best and I have the perfect relationship' attitude yeah. All relationships are tough and NONE are perfect. 

So know that youre not alone. Cheers. I’m sorry to say this OP, but your wife still has that poor people mindset deeply ingrained in her. Yes, you can even give her RM20k/month, but with poor people mindset, that money will be gone in an instant and she wouldn’t even know what she used that money for. 

Design your life now. Decide what’s best for you and your family. The obvious one to correct is your family should live under the same roof. Your wife has no business staying in a different state than yours. She should pack up, leave her job (it’s probably not even a career) and stay with you and the kids. 

Whether you realize it or not, you hold the financial power in your family. You are practically the sole breadwinner. So use that power wisely, with fairness. That is - be fair to YOURSELF (important), your wife and the kids. 

Lay out that plan of yours to your wife, and communicate. If she can’t agree to your plan and don’t even want to discuss it, I’m sorry to say this, but you should find your way out.. After all those expenses, you still have extra RM3k per month…

RM3,000!

That’s a lot in my opinion. You can actually afford a decent place with that kind of instalment; it may not be a super mansion, but it’s something.

But we’re getting vibes that financial “issues” aren’t really the main issue for you right now. You seem to be going through a lot of things from what you wrote.. pompous fool. Widow her bro. Just 3k leftover liquid cash and you have a problem? I struggle to make 3k a month before expenses. 🙄. [deleted]. Best book to read is “Money Sober Money Drunk”. I'm in similar boat with you :( currently we are doing trials where me and my spouse separate our finance so that we can try to spend within our means. Does your wife earn RM7k that's why she spend that much? If so then seperating finance may help pressure her to reduce her spending, get her to still contribute to household spending that is proportional to her spend. E.g if she earns 30% of your salary she should contribute that much, then spend the rest of whatever remaining from her salary.. That is a lot of money. U are being a co dependent by allowing your wife and in laws to take advantage of u.

Take a look at the book, child hood poverty can lead to bad adulthood behaviour as like me having a poverty childhood it leads u to believe poverty os the way to be.. I'm really quite curious what would their reaction be if you say you got layoff from your job.. hire a financial advisor bruh. 7k every month? How does one spend that much, even for general groceries and stuff, 1k a month is enough for a family of 4.. how much savings do you have?. Your wife is the only daughter? No other siblings?. It is easy to FIRE if you make 500k USD per year. Not so much if you're making 120k USD per year living in High living cost area like san fran/nyc/boston etc. If I were you I would go cash with the wife expenses. No more cards.. First you have to tell us how much exactly you and your wife make separately (that gives the combined 28k). That will help us identify the who ought to spend less and where cuts should be made.. Coach your wife to buying mutual reits funds in the name for your children?. That love is gonna kill you some day. Good luck.. Bruh, I earn around 3.5k nett and my wife earns 1k more than me. I pay for food and all the necessities, including utilities and our child's nursery, while she covers the family insurance and occasional luxuries. I don't give her any allowances, let alone her parents, based on mutual understanding. 


I would be dead in a ditch somewhere if I were in your shoes. Communication is key.. [removed]. My recommendation is as follows :

#1 tell her the company decide to do salary reduction because of economic situation and your salary be reduced by 1k .
As such ask for some savings from her end 

#2 use the savings and save first before investing .
Not all investment makes money . Study on how to invest before investing .

#3 consider converting the rental to instalment . House is an asset you can own . Use your EPF for deposit and look at the opportunity to buy your own property . #1 above can help that .

#4 Consider weekend side gig from overseas . This could be via Fiverr or other Platforms. This could start you on your overseas income. Yikes, 7k wife expenses for a wife who is earning her own salary? I don't think can I can afford a "wife" anytime soon.. Idk bro but seems like about 50% of your expenses are related to your wife’s needs - her general expenses, her parents, her insisting in staying in that one state, etc. another 8k (children and student loan) are fixed so no way you can alter that. You can further cut your part but it’s too insignificant. I think you got your solution here like what others have pointed out.

Other option if negotiating with wife is not doable - just wait. Your student loan will be settled in couple of years, and idk your wife’s parents are probably not young anymore, you know…… start planning your finance from these events onwards.

Some Redditors pointed out your problem with insurance. Use that as a leverage to negotiate with your wife, cut down her expenses or move to where you live, and spend the amount saved in insurance. Can put some amount in those insurance saving plan (not a big fan of that but seems might be workable here for you), and cash out the amount at later time once it has passed the no-penalty threshold.. you know again, just to workaround with time factor and to move the money away from your wife. This pains my heart.

Talk to your wife to accommodate your commute at least. Live somewhere near. Relocate. Otherwise tell her to upgrade her skills and get better income.

Touch wood, if shit ever happened to you - they might ended up in Bersamamu!

You're not robot, you can't sustain the unnecessary stress thinking about work, traveling, money and quality time for eternity.. 7k for wife is kindda crazy imo. Perhaps u should talk to her about ur situation and ur plan to buy a house. Plan togather. Maybe even talk her into getting a full/part time job to reduce ur 7k into maybe 2-4k. With her job of 2-4k might help a little. Up ur savings into 5-10k range then u can start planning to own a fairly comfortable home.. Damn man, being a 35 y/o myself, it pains me reading this.

I think a lot has been said already. Just take action and don't let yourself down, don't let your parents down. They instilled money values in you from an early age to hopefully avoid situations like this.

The good thing is you're making what >90% of people here could only dream of making (myself included). Now it's time for you to sort out the other part of the equation. Your efforts now will be better spent on reducing expenses rather than increasing income.

Finally, 3k a month for saving/investing is still better than nothing, make good use of it. But need to increase that in the near future, 3k is what normally someone making 10k/month would save/invest.. Just curious, what does your wife spend the 7k on monthly?. 28k after income tax is a lot....not many people can earn that income.....now I understand  people say money is never enough. This is very true. Both partners' value about money must align, else shits gonna hit the fan sooner or later.

Alternatively you could be the 1 in a million who makes more money than she could spend. That would be the best in both worlds.. Yup, probably more info is needed on this. I do observe there is a separate budget for food and other shopping tho. So I'm wondering if the 7k expenses include things like bills, family groceries etc or just purely spending from your wife?. No, there are no secret savings, it's all spent, guaranteed.. Yeah everything else like food and living space already covered, 7k for personal stuff seems quite too much.. Exactly. 7k a month is too much. Try to have an honest and open conversation with your wife.

Then, pay down as much debt as possible before you start investing. 2k on food is also too much. Cut down on drinks. If you are able to spend <RM10 per meal it shouldn't exceed RM1500. 

And finally, RM2K for the weekly back and forth? Are you flying business class? This can definitely be cut down. I used to travel back and forth between Kedah and Penang every day and it didn't even cost half of the amount.. It really depends on their lifestyle. But in general the larger the human, the higher the costs.. Happy cake day!. OP, I saw some of your comments, and it's raising more red flags.


You mentioned that your in-laws thought "disciplining them means you don't love them". 

When you're apart from your children for period of time, you'll inherently lose some control towards raising & disciplining your children. Currently, they are raising your children the way they are raising your wife.


Please please, take back control before it's too late. Looks like your option now is to bring your wife & children to your state. Be a parent to your children. Don't leave them to grow as incapable individuals.

Again, prioritise what's best for your children.. Yes, a spouse can either 10x your income (like my siblings), or 0.2x it. Good angles, thanks so much.. This^ 

Communication is important. Understand each other then solve the problem together.. This has been done, and as you know I'm no stranger to see how it can work. However, our baselines aren't aligned and this makes it very hard for her.

1. E.g. I will be trying to save most income, but for her, a net 0 is enough. "ah, why are you worrying? It will be okay, there's a few ringgit left."
2. You will be surprised at how many spouses think that it's the norm for the other to do whatever it takes to put food on the table. It's in upbringing. Imagine a person growing up with zero boundaries, where disciplining them means you don't love them (e.g. my in laws will question my love for my kids when I teach them how to use cutleries which needs lots of repetition, so you can imagine how she was brought up). It will take a lot of therapy to change something ingrained in her for 25+ years.
3. As her parents never really grew up themselves, and are themselves incapable of having an adult conversation like you are suggesting (a level headed, rational discussion with an open heart that you may have to compromise on some decisions), it's a tall order to have such a conversation with her - she has no examples or baseline of doing so.. Yeah like wtf? I feel sad for op bro... such a good man. I understand the general view around that. But to be honest, she's really trying to cut down on things - but I'd say that issue here is that money habits seem to be very subconscious. Somehow, she cannot intuit certain things, like multiple small expenses add up to freaking large ones as it has been the norm of her upbringing. So if anything, I'd blame her parents for not bringing her up the right way.. Thanks, you are a great wife and from this comment I see that you possess a lot of self awareness. Unfortunately, things move a lot slower in their context. Changing mindsets and habits are easier when one has been brought up with certain values. Some parents are academically focus, some encourage kids to go into sports. But all have one trait, where the child learns to focus on a goal and relentless works at it for months or years. For my in laws, there has been no such thing. So baselines are vastly different.

For example, mastering a new skill might take a normal person 6 months to a year, and high flyers 1-3 months. But for a member of their family, it might take 5 years due to lack of discipline, consistency, and motivation. I normally see people around me pat themselves on the back when say, they become 2x better at something, but for them, that begins at 0.1x. And then it becomes very hard to sit down and say, I know you feel great about that, but there's actually some more room to go.. From the breakdown it feels like more than 50%. A blessing in disguise, honestly. Stay tough bro.. Well. It’s kinda too late for OP. He’s married
With kids. He’s lost. All the power is with his wife now. I’m curious about the gender of the his children. I hope is not both boys.. No worries, always here if you want to rant. Thanks!. Good for you actually 👍🏻. 300-400 for a dinner once in a while is fine. Average is overkill man. Wagyu A5 every dinner?. Unfortunately, her parents have nowhere else to go and nothing else to earn. They have no education and have no marketable skills (except say cooking?). I feel that they really will eat grass if we stopped funding them. They are also simple minded, old and immobile. That worries me a lot also, because a simple health issue would wipe my whole family out, but I try not to think about it.. Thank you, this has been the most reasonable comment yet. And thank you for not being all judgey on me. I realize I have made mistakes, and want to resolve them so I was fishing for ideas.

Your no.2 approach sounds perfect, and I didn't think about bringing in an advisor but now I will. I feel that the best thing here is to get an actual advisor, as bringing in my parents is a very sensitive issue. You see, although my parents came from B40, in my in laws perspective they are wealthy as that is their current state. As a result, there is an inferiority complex whenever something is suggested by my parents. For example, they did suggest self soothing techniques for children and to bring over some automated household devices they had in their house to mine, and boy, there was huge drama.. And that's not even the elephant in the room 😂

The wife must be living like the First Lady with that appalling amount of "wifey expenses". Considering the food expenses, education fees, diapers what not, infant accessories. Welllll..... Yeah, that's exactly how I have felt. Like I'm not living according to what I'm supposed to. I put this here to get a general feel of whether my situation is widely experienced (my parents combined earnings were less than 10k and yet they lived without much financial worries, surely what I'm experiencing is extreme?) and unfortunately it seems that it's an outlier.. Never underestimate the power of pussy. I was doing alright alone as my upbringing emphasized that. e.g. I saved more as a fresh grad then now. It's just that the current situation compromised a lot of my values.

Yes, convincing them to move closer to where I work has been tried, it's non-negotiable.. It feels like a survey for a drama storyline to see the reactions from random people. I'm so mad at his post to the point I don't feel sorry at all. What OP needs right now is not financial advice or relationship advice, he needs a freaking Superman to save him from this shitshow. Unless he decided to be a MAN, he's going to consider committing suicide soon. Mark my words.. Thanks for the input, that's exactly what I will do. Set a goal and projection and explain why X amount of savings is needed.. Yes, I recently asked and she has provided it and will have a sit down. She's actually not that bad if you live with her in person, just that her idea of money and her upbringing has made her subconsciously embrace certain habits.. My uncle faces the same situation as this guy. Have 2 kids and his ex-wife demand at least 5K for her "personal" expenditure. Turns out she cheated with a lowly-tier police officer and blame my uncle for her infidelity. In court, she lambasted my uncle because he lost his job during the pandemic and tk beri nafkah to her. She demands my uncle's house and a car for alimony.. Communication is key!. Too revealing if there are too many details but there are some liabilities that she took which bloated her expenses. For example, I paid off my car so I don't have that expense while she would have that. There are also other things that she took on like an aethetics expense. 

Yeah right? I know this comes as a culture shock to the community here due to the type of people it attracts, as it did for me.. I am super drained even with flying, as I have been doing it long term + have a demanding senior management role. I feel almost 10 years older than I am, despite being an athlete in my youth, so I'm quite afraid that I have nothing in the tank left for driving. 

Yes, I think food is something I can change. When I was single, I had the same 3 dishes everyday for months. Going to have to bring that back on the table.. Thanks for the rundown, really appreciate you taking the time and effort to streamline it.

No.4 is eye opening. I had no clue how much people gave to parents as I was brought up with the mentality that everybody should be self sufficient (I have no parents or even far relatives who need income for retirement, nor do I have sibings or cousins who give their parents monthly amounts except for one off medical emergencies where the sum is astronomical). His in laws also stays with him (if I understand it correctly). So food should be covered for them.. Very sound advice, thanks. I think she would be agree to be limited to the confines of her own income, but it will be harder to get her to share larger expenses like rental etc.. ikr. Thank you, one of the other high quality comments. The PF account suggest is golden, as I don't think she will want to dive into tracking every little expense just yet.. I'd love to, as I log every day myself. However, due to the huge cultural difference that would be the endgame. Like if she decides to log it the world must be ending. However, introductory stuff like reading would work better, so thanks for those recommendations!. Thanks, finally someone who understands how I truly feel.. Just curious, why are both you and OP letting your spouses have free reign over your money? Is it so hard to only let you spouse (assuming they are not working) access only a fixed amount of cash (reasonable amount) which could be a joint account with monthly auto transfers from your main account. If the issue is with credit cards, you could always use prepaid cards instead such as the new tng visa card or bigpay (alternatively you could drastically lower the card limit of the credit card your spouse is utilising).. Thanks, I was looking for advice like this. As for a better role, I'm always looking out but it seems that it's very hard to earn more than 25k in Malaysia. One could go into consulting but that would mean 0 time for my family for at least a few years, and my children are in their formative years. Any ideas on businesses that have an initial capex of around 36k? That's very doable for me.. Thanks bro. Yeah, seems that the nastier the comment, the less they have something that truly works in the real world. Either they are trolling or they have been emotionally affected by something from their own lives and are projecting it here. When people resort to bashing with emotion, it often means they are unhappy about that very same attribute within themselves. They see that "weakness" around them and it triggers a huge reaction. 

For example, one suggested to go thermonuclear against my wife without any form of finesse and tact. In almost all situations, that would backfire. Trying doing that even from a position of power and see what happens, whether you're the CEO of a company or the USA trying to "liberate" some city state. 

But you are worth listening to, so thank you.. Yes I am going through a lot, and those were my choices and my mistakes, so that's why I was just focusing on what to make of the RM amount.. Desperation can drive you to do some crazy stuff. Knowing I had a 5k loan coming back to Malaysia drove me to go all out at work, and take on any assignment no matter how tough/unrelated it was to my role.. No worries, I did expect all kinds of comments. Taking them with an open heart as I just wanted to see if the situation is common.. This is a shitty advice, regardless of love or whatsoever having that kind of saving will lead them to future conflicts, a ticking bomb to be exact. His children will eventually spend *more* than 3k as time goes by. The sooner they resolve this entire expenses debacle the better they can face the future as a family. 

Also, what the OP posted is not much of a relationship issue to be frank although it's apparent that his partner is the cause of the presented issue. OP just need some wake up call without further putting a blind eye on it.. Thanks, will look it up!. Thanks, will look up that book.. Do you know how much legit ones cost?. About 200k. Yes. She makes 8 and I make 20. Regarding point 1) I honestly don’t think lying is ever the answer. Honestly it could cause OP more stress and further strain their relationship. I would instead suggest OP to firmly control how much of OP’s salary can be accessed by his spouse, and if spouse is working get her to financially contribute towards some of the expenses such as rental, utility bills, child expenses and groceries.. Yes, insurance and other stuff is somewhere in there, I just rounded things up for simplicity. 

I agree that there's a great risk when it comes to what if it comes to a scenario where I'm unable to work or out of a job. I'd probably have to default on the educational loan.. RM230 per day must be spent to reach RM7k per month. It's hard to spend RM230 per day consistently for a month. Find out where the money is going, you might be surprised by the end of the money trail.. Spent on what? Beauty products? Clothes? Are there any items she can cut back on?. I'd like to believe OP has to travel west>east Msia or johor>penang, then it would be justified. Whereas on food 2k is just alright considering he definitely earns above 10k. Purely my opinion. Its the other parts that need rectifying.... Thanksss. Ai. ..talk is easier than do....sorry to tellyou that bro. You need to be a bit more firm. Your wife is like my husband. My husband doesn’t really care about money and say we have enough. While I’m a bit more planner, achiever and love saving. So we have split account that we keep ourselves and joint account where we put money both of us. Those money in joint account go towards mortgage, bills, groceries, vacation. So I don’t touch his private money and he doesn’t touch mine. But we both know that if we need more we can dip into our own savings. I’m firm on my decisions and I told my husband that I was grew up poor so I want to be able not to worry about my old time. He understands it. We reached a solution we both want.

Edit: my mom spends money like crazy so I stopped giving her money and told her I’ll keep it until when she needs it or when her own money runs out.. Tell her that you want to buy a house and leave something for your children. Any good wife should be able to comprehend that.. When I was reading your post it sounds like you're either blinded in love or in delusion. 

But it's clear that you have complete understanding of where the fundamental issue lies. Your partner (and her family) is unfortunately the issue, and it doesnt sound like she is willing to budge because their worldview is just too different.

Whatever it is, I hope you can overcome this hurdle because renting a room with roommates with a personal income of what I assume is around 20-24k is not ideal. You deserve better OP. Yikes. Sounds like the financial issues are merely a symptom of the more serious relationship/behavior issues. 

Honestly, you are bending over backwards to give her a lifestyle that she has dictated. What happens when you try to push back on some of these, frankly, absurd lifestyle requests?. Likewise. I hope OP have the strength and courage to put his foot down and start cutting those unnecessary expenses.. Blame her parents for her (and by correlation, your )- scenario?

Wake up, both of you are adults. Adults take ownership / responsibility of their own lives, make plans for what they need to do to get to where they want to be, and take action accordingly. 

Who agreed to the decision to be with your wife as a life partner - thus binding the two of you legally and financially? Who agreed to the decision to move back to MY (when you know the conversion rate is shit and you have commitments in USD?) Who agreed to the decision to create 2 kids and bring them into this world? Who agreed to two rents in two separate states? Unless she held you at gunpoint at every decision, you’re equally implicated in this position.

Blaming others for your own situation is for little kids who have no agency or control over their lives.. I understand that op. It pains me to cut off some finances to my parents too. We fought a lot abt it. But once they see me changing, they want to change as well. My mother now actively invest whats left of her retirement but I say my father still the same. It is what it is. 

However, I did change. And I changed so much that saving a mere 10k a year is no longer a problem for us. I am also the same age as you op, so 10k savings a year is nothing for my friends, but it is something for me and my husband. If you decide to go on this route, it is a super long journey and learning to change is incredibly hard when you taste money and freedom of not working so much to get there (as you as the husband provides very well). 

I did became self aware after meeting a unit trust/insurance agent. When the agent did the retirement calculation and my husband & I am way way behind. Whatever he saved, I spent. Anyway I was so scared that we might not have anything much in our 50s and it is so common nowadays. 

I really hope things work for you, cz I remember my husband being so sad while explaining to me (but I was angry lol). It did end up good. Take care op!. Jap bbqs. Trying out new restaurants. Alcohol was the killer. Probably i was in denial i could handle it, till it really set me back from important goals (moving out, new car, investments). 

Lesson learned, date people who can give you additional value. Not to supplement their lifestyle. I hope i can stick by it haha. You need to learn a way to handle in law. I got a few ways as I’m used with my mom. If they demand something, just nod and say yes. But don’t do it. Who cares. Just put them off from nagging and don’t let their words linger for long. Lie if you have to. Just yeah yeah and later later okay gtg. Be nice but lie more. Say no more money or whatever. Just don’t agree to their demand much. Please don’t let in laws dictate what goes in and out of your home. It’s your home.. After reading a lot of your replies I think I can see a theme here. It's your lack of financial responsibility. What do I mean by that, if you are the one making the real money it's upon you to take the control of how to spend it. At this point since you are the provider for your wife inlaws and kids you should be the one taking the important decisions. Imagine yourself as the clan leader that everyone is following. Some decisions might sound like this, move your wife and inlaws with you, close to your work. Save money and cover your student loan ASAP. Same money for a down payment for a house. Now the trick is this, let them handle the details but you need to set up the direction, for example, let them decide what house you will purchase, townhouse/condo/bedrooms but they need to understand that you need to save money from your income to pay for it. Also, a fundamental problem is how You negociate this things, from what I can tell you easily give in to their demands which is your problem, you need to stay put and hold on to your demands they will give in eventually as you control the inflow of money you have the control but up until now you just gave away this control. Good luck. I believe sometimes people spend money recklessly because they have no long term financial goal. You need to prepare an excel spreadsheet and show her that if you all can save xx amount a month, how much does that equate to in a year? And how much would that equate to in 20 years. Show her the power of compounding. Put that financial goal in your bedroom or somewhere that you both can visually see everyday. Also subtly change her mindset. Watch YouTube videos on personal finance when she's around. Don't force her to watch. But slowly by slowly, hopefully her mindset will change.. The inferiority complex is so true man. This happens everywhere.. You dont have a money issue, you have a wife issue. Good luck. Blinded by the pussy. In a healthy relationship, there should be no such thing as "non-negotiable" between husband and wife when it comes to family matters. Everything should be negotiated and compromised to the benefit of the family as a whole. So the root cause of your entire problem is an unhealthy relationship with your wife. However, as you mentioned in another comment, you're not looking for relationship advice, you're looking for finance advise, which I doubt will get you far because it is not the root cause, it will merely be a patchwork fixing the symptom. Go fix your relationship.. Good luck I guess ... make the same amount of money from home.. Couldn't find the other comment that you left but just wanted to say you're still young! You can turn things around still. But only you can figure out the solutions to your predicaments, and I believe you eventually would.. Bruh but here ranting about it.. U in denial. this is just so sad… hearts out to your uncle, hopefully he can turn it around and live a more fulfilling life.. Oof please tell me the alimony demand didnt get through.. Wow looks like botox and the likes are in play too.. Please please explain this to your wife. She has to know how it is negatively affecting you. And for the love of God do not downplay your suffering. She has to know, and if she understands but doesn’t care both of you need couples counselling more than a financial advisor…. Seems like you have certain skills or expertise that makes you very very valuable. If you were to go overseas, you could potentially make double your current salary. Might tempt the missus to leave her home town to live overseas?. As i said, if he cant tahan then need to sit down and communicate.

And the reason why i said this is not a good place to seek for rs advice is because a few reply advice op to cut ties with his SO haha.

My apologies if it came out the wrong way.. about rm3000-rm4000. Then it's kind of justified that she spends 7k on herself and 2k on her parents but tell her she should reduce one of them by 1k since she is outspending by 1k. Of course she should also contribute to the kids' expenses and rent but that will be a second step.. No harm to tell the truth but see what works . Different stokes different folks . Sometimes need some event for the behaviour change to happen .. All your problems will be solved if you just sat your wife down and got her to listen. This isn't a personal finance issue, this is a maritial issue. I totally understand this r/raisedbynarcissists mentality, but that is really your only solution. It's not like you're not bringing in enough already.

You need to treat this as a maritial issue, go to counselling etc. Not a personal finance issue. The silver lining is that this isn't an economic consideration, which is generally impossible to solve. Godspeed.. Buddy, no one should live like that. If you are not in control of your money you are not in control of anything.

I feel bad for you man. Hope things turn around for you.. LV bags and designer clothes can easily hit that. Skill issue. I bet even using La Mer would not cost that much. I'll say it: affair. You seemed good at managing money 💰 I used to save first. Then only the spend the  balance.. That's reasonable, my parents did so for us, so why can't I?. There's a reason I was asking for financial advice, not relationship advice. I take ownership for this situation, and the question was to fish for ideas on what to do with the net income that I have left, and how to possibly cut down expenses. 

This comment blames parents, for sure, but it was my intention to soften the blow that people in general had on my spouse. The intention was to say: what's done is done, she was brought up like that, and now what do we have left in the toolbox?. This needs to be higher up lol. Dude is unfortunately on massive copium, this is both a relationship and financial issue. Yes, so you feel my disappointment in life, since you also believe I should be disappointed in myself for every choice I have made up till now, which I am. I can't tell you how much regret I live with every single waking moment.. I’m astonished that his resentment seems to be channelled toward his siblings and begrudging them by his statements like 

How his siblings are ‘working fat cat jobs like typical Ivy League grads’ ‘spend 20k like it’s nothing’ ‘who cares about financial responsibility when you’re earning half a million out of uni’ 

His siblings made better decisions, backed up with discipline and consistently over time and actions.

I don’t think his siblings are the ones he should be expanding energy on here.. Maybe so, but my post was targeted toward what to do with remaining savings, and what to do in cutting costs, not about specifically spouse. The comments section was where it turned that way.. It is quite complicated. It is not easy to accuse someone of "zina" in syariah court. How my uncle found out? Through whatsapp and his kids. The ex-wife brought the kids to the police officer place to sleep with. They are still fighting in court and all of our family pray that she gets nothing from our uncle. But like I said its hard to have a proof of someone doing zina and if my uncle is the one to jatuh talak then he automatically have to pay alimony. So thats that. This experience made me think not to have a marriage. There is no incentive for man these days to get married. Todays marriage is a glorified prostitution. The court are against man.. Thanks, going to put every effort into 2023 to make it work. Because you're a doormat. That's what I am learning about you from this entire post and your replies.. Assuming your wife is not above 60 years old hence is incapable of changing, blaming the way her parents raised her when she could take a step forward to change things herself is not the way to go. The moment we reached adulthood, the blame game on parents should stop. 

This is not an advice per se, but you know deep down what you need to do to dig yourself out of the situation.. Brother, I don’t think this is a financial advice issue though. It seems that you don’t have the capability to challenge your wife and make the necessary decisions which seems like a deep rooted relationship issue. Stop being yes man and challenge her when needed (challenging doesn’t have to be filled with rage, be toxic or condescending. Patience, proper explanation and solid understanding of the other parties views and values is the key here), relationships are built on trust and compromises but it seems that you are the only one compromising.. Man, ignore all these haters just trying to kick a man while he’s down. Mistakes were made, to be sure, but wallowing in regret is not a useful exercise. It is definitely possible to survive on less than half what you’re spending now, but you need to be able to make your wife understand that while living in a specific state might seem non-negotiable, spending more than you earn (which it sounds like you’re one expensive incident away from hitting) is actually non-negotiable. 

You need to have that discussion, however your wife needs to hear it and understand it, even if it’s facilitated by a counselor. I feel your frustration, OP, and I hope you can figure out a tenable way forward.. Regret is fine. Continuing going down a road you are already regretting - that's pretty much on you. Either you change your perspective and be content with what you have or get out of this situation man. My siblings took the path I suggested to them. I wrote their admission essays, prepared them for job interviews, and was deep in every career plan they had. I envy them, because they took my decisions and it paid off, while I stupidly made the decisions I made for "puppy love" and am now literally paying for it.

The bulk of resentment is still toward myself for being so stupid. There is no depth of how bad one can feel for knowing a sure path to a good life, guiding others to it, and never being able to live it oneself.

So I assure you that no amount of bashing you do can make me feel worst.. Cutting cost = ur wife and her family already took up a large chunk of ur income.. Understand that it's non negotiable for a lot of things but that's a decision u made yourself. It sucks earning big bucks but having to save on food and your own accommodation (rent room to cut cost), so tbh to keep ur sanity I'd suggest use the balance 3k "savings" to splurge on urself mate.. 😮‍💨 so sad. I genuinely feel bad for your uncle.. Upvoting this for speaking the blunt truth!. Not just a doormat, he's an ostrich burrowing his head into the ground to avoid the real issue; his wife's inability to spend within means. 

He can hustle to earn more, but no point when the wife only knows how to spend it all.. Yeah. Financial advice would intertwine with life advice. I have a problem with money too until I live on my own and eat instant noodles and some bun for a week or so. My guess is that the wife never have the chance to live independently.. Many men are in this situation. I saw a lot of cases in court where the wife goes hoeing while their spouse works his ass off to feed the family. The sad part is all the wives blame the guy. Imagine you work to provide for your family to give them a good house and food only to be cheated on. Worse, if you break the marriage you are liable to alimony. Technically speaking the man needs to pay for the divorce.. Yeah although my wife and I is also long distance at the moment, but at least I can trust her to not go and hoe around. It is because of this type of hoe behaviour thats why we have MGTOW movement. Do you know what the ex-wife said? She said she cheated because my uncle is not religious enough. Like what! No sense of accountability. This woman has no sense of accountability. Don't know how to cook? Because her husband doesn't provide her with the kitchen like her friend's husband's in ig. Don't know how to manage the house? Because the house is not big enough like her friends in ig. The morning after wake up ig, ws and gossiped with friends. Evening scroll Facebook and shopee until late at night. Complain this and that. When my uncle stood a firm decision said he is dayus and threatened to bruise herself and accuse my uncle of hitting her and publish on FB. Went to my uncle's lawyer said this is normal for a man to experience. Most divorce court cases are toxic women wanting to ruin their husband's life. Only not publicized due to the theory of a man have to be a gentleman.. Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit this beetch is not even for the street. She is for the deepest hell that one could go. Manipulative gaslighting straight up evil. I hope justice prevails for your uncle.. Even my aunt who is a strong feminist said this bitch has to go down. Not all woman is good. This incident made our family more resilient though. My uncle is a good guy type dengar cakap mak ayah type so seeing him depressed made us realize if you fuck with one of us you fuck with all of us.. Caught in the high income high expenses trap and disappointed with life. I probably need some advice, but this is a rant more than anything else.

**Background**

I came from a B40 family (parents were lab techs or lowly government servants). Growing up, we knew the importance of money and I learnt how to save from my parents, who would boycott stuff for years even if the price increase was just 20-50 sens. They would also tally income and expenses every month manually in a ledger, and they started channeling some savings into equities etc. Of course, properties then were lower than they were now, and so my parents eventually had multiple properties. 

My siblings and I were also pushed very hard at school (they still believed that the best investment was education). We had to be it all. Best student, athlete, you name it. What that meant was that all of us were admitted to reputable foreign universities. Unfortunately, I did not get a full scholarship, unlike my siblings. That won't have been a problem if I stayed overseas, since could earn in a stronger currency. 

Fast forward, I met and married my wife who insisted on staying back in Malaysia and in a particular state. For love, I agreed. So yes, it was my decision. But that has brought my family into a financial stalemate. Even after 3 years, we do not have much savings due to very high expenses - something which I would not have imagined to be caught dead with - having being brought up in a low income household who constantly drilled it into my head that "it's not how much you earn, but how you manage it". Summary below.

**Income and Expenses rundown**

1. We take home about 28k MYR a month after taxes. I feel that in any other scenario, we would have been fairly well off. My parents had far less than that.
2. \-RM5k - I am still paying back a study loan which was in USD, and it will be another couple of years before I can finish it. Even a meager amount in USD is insane in MYR! 
3. \-RM 3k - There are now 2 children who incur some expenses every month.
4. \-RM 2k - As my wife insisted in staying in one state, and I had to work in another state to ensure I earn a high enough income to support my study loan and the family. But weekly the back and forth commute adds to expenses. I have half a mind now to stop going back until we have a financial buffer, but I really, really love being with my small children and my wife also does not agree. 
5. \-RM 7k - Wife's general expenses. Although my wife was brought up in an even poorer family (uneducated parents who could only work factory jobs or unemployed), they did not espouse the same thrifty values. This was extremely surprising for me - I wrongly assumed that all people from poor origins would know the value of saving, but she was brought up where her parents were content with their socio-economic situation, alright in living hand to mouth, "borrowed" money from relatives and friends to keep afloat, and didn't have the capacity or viewed an importance to save. I am surprised also because she has a postgraduate degree. Most of her other family members were also contented with earning low and I believe it this mentality is now ingrained in her. So while our expenses are through the roof, she still earns a meager salary and does not seem to be able to advance in position or pay. 
6. \-RM2k - to my wife's parents. She was brought up in a traditional setting where parents viewed children as potential bank accounts.
7. \-RM3k - have to rent 2 places at once since it's in 2 states. 
8. \-RM2k - Food. 
9. \-RM1k - Other general expenses like shopping.

So I am asking if anyone has any ideas:

1. What should I do with 3k leftover a month? What sort of investments (non-bumi) should I take right now? I'm 35 so the runway has significantly decreased. 
2. What expenses can I cut? You may assume that most of what my wife expenses is non-negotiable (although I recently had a chat with her about buying children unnecessary stuff every week and she seems receptive to reducing that). I am thinking of cutting the 2k weekly flights. I don't think I can decrease that by taking the train or bus as my job is intense and I have no energy to spend 5+ hours commuting. I have also recently reduced my rent to live in a room with room mates, even though I am 30+ years old. However, I cannot downgrade my wife's rent as both my child and her parents (they don't have property) with us. 

Generally, I am quite disappointed with life. Even if I were in a high income high expenses situation, I wished it were because I have a mortgage - I don't even have a house at 35! At least that would have been money put towards a possible asset. I know comparing is bad, but I also constantly envy my siblings as they have multiple properties overseas despite being younger than me and are living comfortable lives in fat cat jobs that typical ivy league graduates overseas have. They could come home for a holiday and make RM20k purchases on the spot while we are leisurely walking around the city without blinking. Who cares about FIRE when you're making half a million out of college, amirite?. The situation you're facing is exactly why I am not in a hurry to get a partner right now. Love is one thing, but if the financial literacy (and world view) between you two are incompatible, it will really bring you misery in a long run.

Like what others said, you married the wrong person. She might not need to do much at this moment. But one day if you lost the ability to work (touch wood), your wife will have to take on the whole expenses on her own. Will she able to take it on?

just my 2 cents. I seen a lot of my peers and family members experienced this so this post resonates with me.  


EDIT: Did you factor in insurance in your expenses? Doesnt seem like you have one?. You need to see where your wife is spending the money. 7000 a month is a lot for "wife expenses". If she buys household items then it might be more forgivable. FIND OUT where your wife is spending the money, the best case scenario would be that she is secretly saving up for you. Imagine paying RM2000 for her expenses, you would have 7k additional income to save/invest.. Those 2 children are gonna cost more than 3k soon. The sad truth of "Marrying the right person, you are complete. Marrying the wrong one, you are finished".



As other commenter says. It doesn't matter if your income was 28k or 38k. It's the mindset on financial responsibility that's important. If you can't convince your wife onto the same mindset, everything is pointless.


You have 3 choices:

1. Accept your situation and coast through life. 10-20-30 years down the road, you will still be in the same situation. And worse, you'll then need to rely on your children for your retirement. Is this the burden you wanted for your children?


2. Re-explain to her on the future planning. But now you need to be firm. Take over finances and allocate a more reasonable budget for your wife & parents in law. Be firm.


3. More extreme method, split your finances. Let her cover her own allowances and parents in laws. Will this break your family apart? Maybe. But if you love your children, this might be a burden you should shoulder. Prioritise what's the best for your children's future.. I stopped reading halfway. TALK WITH YOUR WIFE!! Make a budget and expenses and show it to her. And plan your next step with how she reacts. I love my husband and in no way I will let him struggle hard. We are a team and we need to work on it together. See your parents, they are very involved as team.
Edit: Make budget, expenses, retire plan, saving plan and stick to it.. Bro pls la. Move your wife and kids near you and stay with them. Feel sad reading this man and that you have to have share a room with roommates at 35 despite making 28k. Just put your foot down and start cutting costs drastically. Not easy because she’s your wife but I guess you have to somehow persuade her. 

With saving one place rent, commute and cutting down on the 7k you give her, I think can push your savings to 10k a month minimum.. You married the wrong person.

Or to be blunt, probably a gold digger.

She earning peasant salary while her expenses and expenses due to her takes up more than half of ur pay? Red flag. 

You have to support her parents? Red flag. 

Ask her to pay for her own expenses. You are not her ATM. Is time for u to put your foot down.. Hi Op. I’m sorry that things did not go as planned and I can sense that you are frustrated. I’d like you to know op that I was that wife. Wasting my husband’s time, money, and effort a way. I quit a 5 figure income because of stress, and keep on shopping like I didn’t. Anyway op, my husband had a talk with me and spread out a ledger. 

We made a financial goal plan together to clear off my debt first. I made major life changes, turned into minimalism (not like those aesthetic ppl in Youtube, just having less stuff & buy in bulk etc). 

I may be a graduate, a working adult, but money management is a separate thing to learn. We bought books and read abt house flipping, savings, four hour work week etc. Basically he tried to change my random fashion, coffee hopping, duck scarves shopping into something more fun. It was a long journey a lot of heartache, but damn I learned so much. Took abt 5 years to finally save money and invest. 

Cook with her, do cheaper activities (hiking, yoga, home arts), get an insurance agent or any finance bros to explain to her abt the reality and what is out there, buy books abt finance and retirement and read together. 

I wish you only the best. The rut isn’t forever.. Why would you agree to all these demands at the first place? I mean paying for your children' expenses that I could understand.

But her parents'? She should support her own family, not you. I can only think that the situation would improve when you pay off your student loan; have your wife cut down her unnecessary expenses; get a divorce; or you die/run away.

Man I would run away like tonight.. haven't divorced yet, she is already robbing the 50% 😅. Interesting for me to come across this post, as i just got dumped by my-ex simply because she viewed me as not able to provide the luxuries in life. 
Currently my (32.M) mthly salary is of 9.8k while she's (33.FM) with 8k. 

Some parts of me felt betrayed as i stayed with her while she struggled to move up in life - while I've been stagnant in my own career, worrying bout her. And spent ungodly amount of my own money trying to feed her by eating out nice foods (avg rm300-400 per dinner). And ungodly amount of grabfood during mco for her. 

Simply put, i may have dodged a bullet in the end as she indirectly admitted she's a gold digger. 

Just gonna remain single for now and focus on self-love and of course recalibrate my finances for my own future. 

Sorry my comment is not helping, but just sharing my sentiments. Good luck OP. This is my 2-sen, feel free to tell me to fuck off :)

It doesn't matter how high your income is... one would usually be caught in this trap regardless.

Let's say suddenly your take home income increased from 28K to 38K. Your expenses would automatically increase anyway.

Of course I am not in your situation where huge chunks of $ have to go to parents and out of state spouse.

But your wife and her parents don't seem to be too understanding unfortunately.

I make a LOT LESS than you, but I think I have a much more financially comfortable life than you do.. I see a lot of comments have addressed the obvious. I'd like to point out you have a huge privilege many people who came from B40 backgrounds don't, parents who have lived with less and still managed to save.

My suggestion is to save every receipt for a month. Don't control your wife yet, just ask her to save every receipt and then sit down and key in the detailed expenses in an excel sheet. Review where the spending is really going and then use your parents as 

1) advisors on where you can consider cutting spending

2) how to talk to your wife about getting on the same page as a couple

of course, some parents might not be the most uh PC about this so whether you include both, just the most rational one or whatever is for you to decide. You can always just do (1) and see what feedback they give. 

When our expenses ballooned recently (SO has subsidiary cards of my CC), my SO got defensive when I told her we had to cut costs. When I brought it up again a few days later, I instead talked about what I'd like to do with her, (in my case, extravagant super lux honeymoon) for you it could be something like buying a house together. When I approached it this way, she had something to look forward to and started volunteering which expenses she could cut out so we can save more.  

The first approach felt like it was a her problem, the second approach was a goal we are aiming for together.. This is mostly a relationship issue from mismanagement of expectations. Your financial situation is just a byproduct of that. So talk about that instead of talking about numbers with your wife and get your priorities aligned first before anything. Good luck going forward.. RM3k for just 2 children??? Oh man after reading this i dont i think i want to start a family anytime soon. Your wife's is taking s over 10k-15k of your total income..that is crazy, it's time to sit down and have a serious discussion about money and moving forward.

Yori kids expenses will continue to increase, even if u send them to gov school. 

Have a serious discussion about moving your family to your place of work, give your wife a choice, it's either that or cut down general expenses and payment to parents

At 28k a month u are in T20 bracket but living like M40. Bruh, 28k take home and you're disappointed in life? You should be disappointed in the choices you've made. Even though it could be argued that a lot of things were circumstantial and whether we have free will to begin with, you've made a lot of choices that landed yourself where you are today. You say you know the importance of money but it doesn't seem like you're that great at budgeting to begin with. 

You could convince your family to move closer to where you work but since you've positioned everything your wife demands for as a non-negotiable, I'm not sure what you can do apart from making another 10k lol.

Technically you can afford mortgage with the remaining 3k, but not all mortgages are good investments anyway.. Echoing everyone else, your wife's expenses need to be cut. But I think the way you should approach it is as a team. There is a budgeting app called YNAB that just recently released a partners version. You and your wife know the monthly incoming, now it's time for you to decide collectively where each of those ringgits will go using the app as a tool. Hopefully, by using the app and making those decisions up front, she'll be better at controlling her expenses.. Dude, I hate to be blunt but you're a doormat. That's what I am learning about you from this entire post and your replies.

Your income before taxes is probably around RM33-35k. That puts you into the top 2-3% of households in Malaysia. 

Your wife at best sees you as an ATM card, as a means to an end.

What on god's earth is she spending RM7k on in personal expenses A MONTH? 

Do you understand that RM7k gross salary puts a household firmly in the M40 bracket???

Why do you need to kowtow to her every whim? Are you a simp? 

You say she has financial issues, no it is you that has them. You gotta step up, be a man, and tell her what's what. 

RM7k personal expenses for your wife? Fuck no, RM7k expenses for an entire family of 4 a month is plenty enough (excluding rent / loans). 

RM2k to her parents? Fuck no even more. You don't pay for that shit.

Living in separate states / separate homes? Dude, are you even a man? What reason does your wife have to choose to stay away? 

Financial issues are the least of your worries here, your relationship seems weak and one sided. You sure your wife doesn't have a proper man on the side? 

And finally, what the hell are you even teaching your kids man? 

Be a man, that's my only advice. 

P.S. You can start by no levelling any blame at your wife's parents.. Hi OP. My 2 cents is that this is less a financial issue but rather a relationship issue. I know you posted here to get financial advice though so feel free not to read further.

But if you do, could i suggest the following. You mentioned you would like to have some savings. But maybe take it further. 

Work out what you need that savinga for, whether it is for a rainy day, whether it is for your kids education, to buy a house, etc etc. 

Then work out how much you really need for each and then calculate backwards to show how much you would need now (including if you regularly invest in non risky assets). Do take into account inflation too.

Once you have that, then it becomes the starting point for a conversation with your wife because you have clear data points because it is not just about "we are spending too much" but rather "if we want to svae xx amount for xx reasons, this is what we need to set aside every month and this is the remainder for spending. What trade offs do we need to make to achieve these xx saving goals for OUR family"

Know its easier said then done but hope this helps.

Oh and i would suggest you start to keep some savings and spending for yourself. Perhaps this year and the next, the economy is bad and there was 'no increment' and 'no bonus' wink wink or even a reduction in salary wink wink wink. Does your wife have the breakdown of rm7k monthly expenses? If not, I think you should start with that. Slowly talk to her about cutting down some of her expenses. Tell her all of that saving is for the children's future. Try to put the financial data into an Excel worksheet or something to convince her.. So, your real-problem is human-relation/mentality-problem (not financial, pls don't desperately fall into investment scam), this problem is kinda common and widespread. 

Take some sugars, let us understand and try to get a resolution by digging into your wife's side mentality first. 

'Take it for granted' this is the root of the problem, doesn't matter the person is a beggar or billionaire, you will be surprised most of the world may have such mentality (human's nature, we enjoy free stuffs). University does not really teach you to be a better human. 

Communication and compromises have to be made to solve the 'take it for granted' mentality, we are humans with family and love our families. You don't cut-off your family to fix the problem (no bullshit). 

I will write more later, if you're interested in communication-solutions.. You have 7K for wife's expenses and 2K for wife's parents. That's 9K coming out of your pocket every month! Even if your wife's parents' money is non-negotiable (I still think it's high and wonder if your wife is an only child supporting her parents), your wife's expenses itself is exorbitant. List down everything she's buying, see if what she's buying is really needed. Soon enough you'll see that the non-negotiables are actually negotiable.. Can't stress enough the importance of finding the right partner who shares similar financial values.. I think your main issue is to maintain 3 households( you, wife and child, wife parents). If you move your wife and children to your place it could consolidated a lot of the spendings like rent and food.

However the main thing is to spend more time with your children. Because if you don't instill good financial value in them NOW twenty years down the road you are dealing with 3 person with zero clue about spending.

Less traveling for you, more family time...

I still wonders what sort of beauty regime in "cheaper state" can cost up to 7k per month..... Son, asking for advice on what to do with the 3k you have left is like putting a band-aid on an axe wound.

Stop. The. Bleeding. Now.. Hey OP, just curious. What’s stopping you from personally controlling her expenses and making the decisions on where your family lives (not in a toxic way but in a we need to work together for a brighter future kinda perspective)? 

1) Only allow your spouse access to a fixed monthly expense budget. If your spouse is working and is spending within her income, establish fixed contributions (e.g 3k has to be transferred to shared savings every month (could be a split of retirement, fun money and child education), have to chip in for the rentals, groceries etc..). 
2) Firmly let your spouse know that you should be living together as a family (no good reason not to, parents or lifestyle are not good enough reasons to be honest as it will benefit both your mental stability, financials and the upbringing of your children)
3) Is your spouse working at all? If she is, parents pocket money should be fully footed by her. It’s her parents after all, you should be spoiling your parents instead.
4) Draw a picture to your wife in detail the outcome of current spending habits, e.g no money for children’s education, no retirement money etc… Paint a scary picture, find some real world examples. 
5) From your responses it seems that you are not willing to challenge your spouse and parents in law especially in terms of financials and child upbringing. I think it’s time for you to stand up for yourself and what you believe is right, challenge their methods in a civil and loving manner, use yourself and your family as good examples etc… and most importantly it’s your children and your money you should have a say in what happens to them (as long as it’s for the benefit of your kids and your health) 
6) In my personal opinion, this may be the most important. Please please please have a heart to heart with you wife on how this is negatively affecting you. And please for the love of god do not downplay any part of it. A good spouse should be more concerned about your health and your children’s future over spending money no ifs ands of buts. 


Sincerely good luck OP, hope you can turn this around without too much bloodshed and soured relationships. More importantly please remember that your opinion matters(more so in this context), children need a father figure in their lives and your mental health is important too. Better to challenge them and cause discomfort and strain on the relationship than being constantly unhappy and potentially having suicidal thoughts.. JFC, this is why I constantly tell my surrounding people to master their own emotions, to always maintain a habit of think rationally and stay realistic regardless of the topics, which today's people failed consistently for some reason. Love can be poisoning and unsustainable if you act upon it without consider much of the consequences.

This entire situation is not caused by the insufficient income earnings or whatsoever, but it is because the distribution is so uneven in the first place. You all need to sit down, take a long talk about the future and reshuffle the entire expenses then set your priorities straight. Let's be real: in the future you eventually need to give the best education for your children, having this kind of expenses and saving distribution is very, very concerning. I don't consider myself as an expert in saving monies **but the fact that I feel horrified by the information you given speaks a lot of the absurdity**. 

You both are adults now, I think it's time for a talk, a long one especially. If you all intend to walk through life together, side by side, you guys need to talk.. I am mad as hell. How can 28k is not enough? 😭 But yeah man, just start talking to your wife about her spending and stop funding her family for god sake.. have you try to communicate to your wife and ask what her expenses is to the point that its taking up 1/4 of your income,youre the main breadwinner of your family, COMMUNICATE and try to lower your expenses to your wife, dont really wanna comment about your relationship with your wife but try start talking with her first and find out whats going on with that expenses.

if you can manage to cut down atleast 3-4k from its already good enough imo, youre a husband you should be atleast strict about the financial need of your wife.. Not to be judgemental but how is she spending 7k per month? That is insane.
Buying stuff for children should fall under children expenses. Is she just going out to spend everyday or what? 2k to her parents is also questionable, even more so when it's you that is paying, I feel as if those 2k should fall under wife's expenses as well no?
I'd generally give her 4k including the money for her parents, totalling up to you having 8k every month in saving.. My husband was bought up in the same environment as your wife. He literally had no financial literacy nor future planning and was content with living from pay check to pay check. 

Mind you, he earns more than I do, and I earn more than 2x of what your wife spends a month. We’re supposedly well within the T10 based on the latest salary categorisation. Imagine spending so much monthly on things that will break down in a few years instead or investing in your future retirement.

He’s much better now. We spoke alot about finances after having a kid, and he has attempted to cut down on spending. He still spends on alot of ‘man toys’ but atleast he has way more savings in his bank account now than before. I did tell him to think beyond the temporary happiness that he feels from buying stuff he don’t need every month just to deplete his bank account and I think it worked?  We’re also able to afford a couple of properties after some financial adjustment. 

Personally, I feel RM7k is abit too much money to be spent each month. Maybe try asking your wife to itemise her monthly expenses and get her to Marie Kondo her spending style? Sometimes people aren’t aware of how much they spend unnecessarily until they see it itemised out in front of them.. 

If I were in your shoes, I would try the following 

1. Take 1-2 months leave from my work ;
2. Tell my wife I have lost my job and will be moving back home;
3. Start paying for everything but cancel her cc to track expenses;

The idea here is to see when income (theoretically) dries up, how much can the family really cut down on expenses in order to survive. Abit like a fire drill but everyone else doesnt know.

Silly suggestion. Feel free to ignore. kek. why does your wife sound sabahan?. Many have already mentioned about your wife, and at least one has suggested advancing your career which I have no doubt you are trying to already do. So let me offer my 2 cents on rent, food, and travel

On travel, are you flying back and forth? If so, consider driving occasionally as it is far cheaper. Whenever I drive to and fro between KL and JB, the total cost for petrol and toll is around RM160 per return trip. Just bear in mind that it takes more time and energy, but that's the price to pay. 

Rental, RM3k a month is high. Consider renting a room for yourself if you have not already done so. I don't know how much your wife's rental is, but I assume it's for a house with the kids around. You can also consider at least buying a home at her state, then at least the money goes into property from which you can recover next time when you sell it. 

As for food, honestly RM2k is a lot, it most definitely can be cut down. When I bought my own house, I had to cut down on food and just eat the simplest home-cooked meals. Just rice, some eggs, and veggies for the weekdays. I have no mood for a tasty meal on weekdays anyway as I'm on autopilot slogging through work. Weekends are when I allow myself a bit more pleasure in life by buying some nicer ingredients to cook and eat at home, sometimes going out too. 

Note that I'm only suggesting steps pertaining to costs that affect, and can be controlled, by you only. Just keep all the savings quiet from your wife.. Perhaps swapping wife and child expenses would be somewhat better. There OP. You have a clear mind and listed down the main problem already. 

What I think you could do:

1. Talk to your wife. As the root of the issue is her spending habit. Cut that down and save a few k more for other purposes.

2. Prioritize the investment first. Set some goal, for example, 8k per month and throw it into a fixed monthly investment or saving account (with or without your wife knowledge). Just tell your wife this is the first thing that you should deduct and the 20k is all you have for now. 20k is definitely enough for most family. 

3. Cut the unnecessary expenses. Is there a way to save on rent? As you work without your family in other state, maybe rent a smaller house for few hundred to a thousand? Ask your wife to cook more? 

4. 2k to wife parents? I’m giving only to my parents 1k and their groceries even I earning 20k alone! I won’t be giving my in law any money tbh. Don’t your in law have other children or son? Just support their monthly groceries if you want. 2k is too much. 

5. Open another bank account without your wife knowledge and put money inside. Declare to your wife and family that you earn lesser now. Save the remaining for other healthier purposes like deposit for house or share investment. 

That’s all about it man. Don’t be disappoint in life because of this. You know the problem, and if the root cause doesn’t change, just change the surrounding on the root cause.. You are a sweet man. There are going to be some difficult conversations ahead. I wish you guys the best. 💜. There has to be some compromise. Mayb she and ur children can move to the state you are working. That way no need to spend on flights and additional rent. Can put downpayment on a house. 7k spending on herself is high if u are already paying for all else. Perhaps can sit down n discuss where the big leak on your expenses. All the best.. Hey OP, you came for financial advice and you got bashed. Just wanted to say, kudos for making the effort, please don't let the negativity get to you, and stay strong for yourself, your family, and your future.

(That being said, not sure how you thought you could write up this post while being so vague about the biggest expense you have and not expect to get a scolding from the community. Not doubting that 7k is an unreasonable expense but without some transparency into how that is broken down, everyone is left to imagine all sorts of wild things.)

\- Food - You work in senior management, right? So... it wouldn't be unreasonable to... look at your employment contract or speak to HR about entertainment allowances to help offset some meals should you dine out? And/or learn to cook simple, healthy meals for yourself, with local ingredients.

\- Weekly flights - 2k sounds a lot, I'm assuming you're the one flying back and maybe this includes grab fares or something. Since it's domestic, maybe take advantage of sale periods and buy further ahead of time.

\- Rent - 3k for two places doesn't sound too bad honestly. Please don't rent a dinky room somewhere and sacrifice your peace of mind.

\- The kids - What's your plan for them in the future? Do you want an overseas education of them? Do you think you'd be able to support their education, or imagine that they'd also take on an education loan like you did, thus repeating your cycle of debt? If I were you, I'd do the math on how much it'll take to support the kids until undergrad and have a discussion with my wife about that number, and what it'll take for both of you as their parents to get them there.

Wishing you all the best in life, buddy. It's never too late to get back on the horse.. Hello OP, was just browsing through and saw your post. Really feel for you, my life situation is quite different to yours but for many reasons I just feel like I can identify in quite a few things you are saying. I have seen similar things play out with my parents and other relatives. In terms of technical financial ideas I don't have anything anyone else hasn't already said but I do have a few points of reflection that might be able to give you some thoughts like the ones below.

1. Many people from lower income situations (regardless of race) can get into problems with personal expense management when they get into a higher earning situation. Part of it is because they are "compensating" for the time they could not have what they wished for. From your wife's point of view, she now has a husband that is 'a high flyer', so maybe a lot of her financial discipline she had when poorer has been released and that is probably linked to your issues. To get this under control, you need to get your wife to wake-up and realise that while things are now very good (from an income point of view) it doesn't mean that all your dreams can come true at the same time. Some people might even go to counseling (I know this is still a taboo topic in Malaysia) but this can be one way of confronting any hidden thinking and decision making processes that come from your wife's early days. People are a lot more complicated than we sometimes think. It is probably linked to habits as well, and people sometimes think they cannot change that. If this is the case going through a book / Audiobook like James Clear's Atomic Habits might help (looks like she is quite intellectual as you said so this approach may work). If you can talk to her you need to work on this as you already know.

2. Is it possible that your wife's spending patterns will drop if she stops going to work? As you have said she isn't in a high paying job, but by going to work she might be outside more, going shopping more, going to eat more, buying more things for the kids to compensate for not being at home, maybe if she was at home there just removes a need for her to spend so much?Maybe she does have habits that are good (like cooking etc) that will save money when you change the environment she operates in. Same for you as well, will changing your environment with work change your spending habits (for sure it will if you are not staying remote from family for instance), and maybe you will actually be happier? Things to think about and it affects many high end professionals more than your know. 

3. From an earnings standpoint you are doing well, you would be doing well even in an overseas country pay wise. Unfortunately expenditure wise you would also be on the high side in some overseas countries outside of Malaysia so you are not getting ahead financially as you should be. But, with family in Malaysia and effectively on an overseas salary the potential is always there for you to be in a very good financial position. Many Malaysian expats would actually love to be in your shoes (minus the obvious problems with travel and partners expenditure of course). You've done the hard work, now just got to convert it to push you forwards.

4. Have you optimised your tax position with your pay and student loan situation? You didn't say if you were being paid in Ringgit or in overseas currency, but if you are being paid overseas, have a good look at whether you can restructure the payment of your student loan so that it is more being paid out of your net earnings completely in that country. Helps if the tex rules make it worthwhile, so do ask around and get professional advice here.

5. We are likely going into a global situation where economic growth will slow, loans become more expensive and inflation hits harder and harder. Start looking at your loans and cut off anything optional now, sell off expensive cars or things on a loan that will not appreciate in the future and ride it out. Tough times tough choices.

6. Own a European car? Euro cars (or at least the ones we aspire to in Malaysia) are always a maintanence issue when they get old enough and when stuck in the heat. Never good for maintenance costs, unless you are your own mechanic (and I'm assuming you just don't have time for that). If you have to get an older car to save money think of getting something safe, but probably non-European and with good fuel economy to cut down on maintenance costs. 

7. Not the first thing you will think about at this time but take care of yourself and don't get sick or injured. If you do at this point it gets ugly. Much uglier than however it turns out any other way.

8. Sometimes there are just no silver bullet solutions. You need to make small changes and over time they add up and count. Getting into this habit with controlling spending and saving money is very powerful.

9. I get from your posts and comments that you seem to be a pretty agreeable and what people would say is a nice guy. Remember that with this character, sometimes to do the best for our loved ones and family long term we have to forget who we are in the short term, be a bit stricter and harsher in order to be the best we can be in the long term.

All the best. You have a very bright future ahead of you don't let your times when you are at your lowest. Make a plan and make those changes, however small, one at a time. Make steady changes, give it some time and you will get there.. I don't have any financial advice for you, but I have a little encouragement for you and maybe a suggestion to view things in a better lens. You have 2 children, a wife, parents, siblings and most importantly and i know i'm assuming here, health. A lot of people don't. Your monthly home income seems alright. I think tho you can still try to find solutions to the problem you think you have right now, it's best to view it at a more positive tone. It sounds like you are not happy and miserable when i can tell you i would trade my bank savings to be able to live your life. Your siblings have a different path in life. You as well. Be the best dad you can and that means being truly happy. Find happiness not in your success in material and money, but in something that is unshakeable. Such as personality, a good human being, or just an all around great dad / husband to your family. 

My siblings both earn way more than me too. My younger one works abroad and gets paid 3X more than i do. So i know the feeling. But i love my siblings and i am genuinely happy for them. I also know my own life has its course. And i dont want to chase money or materials tho i will work hard for it. I just want to live 1 day at a time. Because i want to make sure my health is still ok. Hope that helps you navigate through your problems in a lighter way. Cheers.. I would suggest a few thing and see if you could make it work.

1.) Managing your expenses

Nobody like to be micromanaged and it would be hard to limit your wife's spending just by her discipline. Going through her spending is helpful to check if she really need to spend all of that 7k per month. On managing your wife's or rather your family's expenses, I would suggest give her a lump sum RM10k and ask her to manage for the following:
a.) Rent at your children's place
b.) Spending for the children and family 
c.) Her parent's spending (the 2k)
d.) Her spending

Be mindful that the T20 starts from 10k for most state in Malaysia. I'm sure 10k is more than enough. 

2.) Save as much as possible and secure your funds

Get into some kind of commitment for force saving. For example monthly contribution to SSPN for your kids, buy property, unit trust or stocks. In this case, when your wife demand more money, you could make the excuse that you do not have cash as it is all tied up in your property and investment. Touch wood in case your wife's parents need medical treatment, it's easier to admit them into government hospital instead of cutthroat private hospital when you don't have cash sitting in your bank account.

As others had mentioned, making your wife understand the goal is important. For example you might want to save for your kids education overseas or buying a property for a place you could truly called home or bring your kids to travel once every year etc.

3.) Prepare for your retirement

I don't mean to induce anxiety in you but to serve this as a wake up call. I hope you have your EPF is loaded enough to somewhat cover you and your wife's retirement. If not you should seriously start to look into this and ramp up your saving. Check how long does it takes to reach FI and how much you need to save [here](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) 

If you need to spend half your current salary (14k) per month after retirement, you'll need to save half of your salary (14k) for 16 yrs (when you're age 51) until you can retire with FI, this is without considering EPF of course.

4.) Increase your spending

You must equipped with some special skill to make people pay you over 400k per year. Leverage on your knowledge and skill and try to earn additional stream of income, most probably from 

a.) providing consulting service
b.) business ventures with you having smaller or no capital contribution but offering your expertises
c.) leveraging on your professional license is you have any. I think its not money problem... its wife problem. If you dont fix your wife, you're gonna have a bad time in future. When negotiating a cut down of expenses, don’t forget that lifestyle readjustments take time because habits take time to develop. If you want to keep your marriage and family, negotiate steadily but softly. 

Also, you may want to consider broaching some of these matters with a challenge and a what if. 

what if I lost my job? Can you pick up the slack while
I cared for kids? what if i had trauma and can’t work for awhile? how about a challenge that you can live on 2k a month instead of 7? how prepared are you to go back into poverty? 

Also, you need to be prepared to face some fire. both of you should see a financial planner then you put your foot down and hopefully both conclude that “we are saving 6k a month, 3 from me, 3 from your current expenses.. Maybe it is time to pull out the "If you love me" card. Tell your wife, if you love me can you please cut down your spending so that I at least I don't have to share room with other people?. Cut the 2k u give her parents and tell her if she wants to give her parents money take it out of the 7k. You kill two birds with one stone; reduce her spending by 2k and saved yourself 2k. Eventually your student loan will be paid off and you will have alot more breathing room and less stress. Obviously the location thing should be sorted as well if u explain to her the stress you are going through because of the traveling and staying together will help you both emotionally AND financially.. This post is very sad and I keep coming to see your replies. Not much thing to be said about financial recommendations since others have offered their insights. You are disappointed with life, and at this point you knew already what significantly contributes to that disappointment. 

Things are really complicated when it involves the person we love, and more so when children are added into the scene.

One thing I noticed, you send money to her parents but i see none for your parents. You mentioned about how your parents educated your siblings to bring out the potential to the highest and they did a good job educating you how to manage money. I wonder if they are still alive. 

You seem to care for your family a lot, but financially one-sided. You give them comfort even though you have to sacrifice yours, mentally, physically and financially. I don't see anything related to your entertainment from the expenditure breakdown. You are a great father and husband, and thank you for that.

Therefore for you to be willingly burdened with all these, I assume your wife must have her fair share of sacrifice too not in financial matters like taking care of the children and the house, and giving you the love you deserve. Hopefully things will be well for you after this.. Moral of the story: that bussy be deadass good to fck over a man's potential like that.. You're about to get r/relationships 'd. After reading all the replies and comments, i think the best way to move forward for you family is for your wife to note down all her expenses. I use money manager to track every RM and it has open my eyes to all the big expenses in my life. You should really get her to note down everything being spent and maybe you do it together with her as form of encouragement and support. It will help her see where the biggest expenses are and at least give her a direction to focus her effort. 

Since you're looking for advice, I'm just going to throw this out there....I'm sure you have talked to her a lot about personal finance but I think another good way to get her to learn is if you have her follow some PF accounts on IG or FB. I've personally learned a lot over the years...the information is bite sized so they're easy to understand and remember (at least for me).

The hard truth needs to be spoken to your wife. If you continue living life this, you will never be able to set up your family for success. If you buy a house, you'll be stuck paying it off for 30 years instead of being able to settle it 10-15 years earlier with your savings. 

Sorry to sound harsh but unfortunately that's the reality of it.  Good luck OP. So sorry you are in this situation - I can’t really relate because my bf would never fund my lifestyle (you give your wife 7k a month wow) and we split our expenses 50/50 via Splitwise (I know very unAsian and unromantic) because he thinks that’s fair and tbf we have gotten used to it lol. Maybe get your wife to log her day to day spending (for the household etc. in Splitwise so you can have a look and where’s she’s spending the money? Also recommend having her read Psychology of Money, great book and helps shift the way you would typically think about money. Money values are really the result of upbringing so I feel bad for you and your wife, I also grew up poor and thus had a strong urge to make money (I currently work abroad away from family also because of the higher income) whereas my bf grew up very comfortable and is from a well to do family but his parents used to scare him saying he will become homeless if he doesn’t work hard so he’s very frugal and careful with money. We are both working towards achieving FIRE / probably with 0-1 kids and it does make one feel way more secure having a partner with similar life goals and financial values. Also recommend reading Mr. Money Mustache or listening to FIRE podcasts just to slowly guide your wife towards changing her mindset and spending less. I give my mum monthly allowance too so I see why that might be harder to be cut but again the 7k might be a good place to start or you might consider buying a house and spending part of that 3k on a mortgage for your wife and kids to live in (since they are not keen on moving anyway and presumably live in a cheaper state? I am guessing you work in KL?). Good luck!. After reading half the comments here, despite most people have good intentions but kinda harsh… I think OP really love his wife and family and probably that’s why he’s trying to not blame his wife in the 7k spending by shifting the blame to her upbringing… I think OP should have a calm discussion and conversation with the wife on what you both want to have financially in future… I feel like you both are not on the same page (despite the personal upbringing or money spending habit).  Then probably slowly cut down the spending? Instead of going from 7 to 2k, maybe to 5k first? Then gradually “train” her into spending less monthly on her stuff. 

Either way, if your wife is an understanding person (again despite her spending habits), if you can convince her that by having the same financial goals (buying property/savings for retirement), then it can be solved gradually. 

Another thing is, if you had agreed to move back to Msia due to commitment to your wife, then don’t regret it. As this will create unnecessary tension between you two. Instead of thinking what you could’ve did, why not think what you can do now to improve your distance situation.

Just my 2 cents

EDIT: I saw some comments recommending to educate the wife financially, I’m going to say that is probably very difficult,that’s why I said to paint a picture of a financial goals together will be easier for her to grasp the concept. If one thing I learn in marriage… do not try to educate directly, most of the time won’t work. 🤣. The big red flags are the weekly flights (did you purchase everything last minute? 2k is a bit high for weekly flights for a month) and the appalling amount of "wife expenses". With a 28k/month household, you should be able to get your hands on a few properties at this point instead of renting. The 2k cut to be siphoned to your in-laws should be taken out directly from the "wife expenses". Your wife must be living like royalty with 7k of expenses per month. As someone just said, it's RM230 per day consistently for a WHOLE DAMN MONTH - I would have an easier time literally burning the money than finding something to spend it on. 

There are families out there with HALF the amount of your total household income who are able to lead a way more financially comfortable life than this. 28k is nothing to sneeze at. You can't possibly expect anyone to take this seriously and recommend some enlightened financial-guru-y tips when both of you are raking in that much income per month while being the exact opposite of frugal.

Both of you really need to start documenting expenses IN DETAIL and categorizing them in excel sheets now (I have a pretty complete automated macro-enabled template, if you're interested, you can DM). Once you start the process of recording every expense, even little ones, you'll get very self-conscious of the astronomical amount of wastage and get somewhat discouraged from spending extravagantly down the road.. Lmao you don't have a finance problem, you have a wife problem. Sorry to be blunt but you married a gold-digging leech and she and her family are sucking up all your money. She's just stepping all over you and you're letting her do it. Like you said, you don't even own any real assets because it's all going towards her upkeep including the 3k in travel expenses between your two rented homes which is sad enough as it is but you're also giving her 7k in shopping money even though she has a job and is highly educated.. Yo WTF? 7k per month for your wife??! And you guys earned 28k per month. This is a perfect example of "20k salary still not enough if..." 

Like others said, you really need to talk with your wife about her spending habits. Even if you still want to finance her parents (2k) as long as you she can reduce her spending to at least half it's good enough for the time being. Come live with you, cannot. 
Decrease spending, cannot. 

I’m sorry but separation would probably be the only good option. Focus on giving money for your kids spending and education. Up to 30k a month and still having this kind of trouble, really cannot brain. 

All in all, goodluck sir.. Things people do for love.. I grew up poor just like you and learned the same values. And my wife is exactly just like your wife. I constantly have conversations and discussions with her regarding savings and being thrift with money. Two weeks later, and she's back to her old thoughtless spending. Wash and repeat. Over the years, I've kind of sarcastically viewed this behaviour to being, 

A) wah! Got money! Spend! spend! spend!
B) it's not my hard earned money, so I don't know how to appreciate it! Spend! Spend! Spend! Still got more right!?
C) what is being thrift? I've never had to do that before, so troublesome, just spend! Spend! Spend!

I tell you, sometimes I have no balance from my salary and it's slowly eating up my savings.

To change and install a new understanding and behavioural concept to someone who grew up not knowing it, is quite honestly very hard. But not impossible. Just have to keep at it and put it to practice. When we go shopping for groceries, if I think something isn't worth it, I'll pick up a cheaper option. Small things like this has an impact to slowly get her to follow suit... Good luck my friend.. Kudos to you for having the strength and mental capacity to go through all that. Salut. Many husbands are trapped just like you.. Dear OP, the most important question to ask yourselves is: are u happy. If u are happy, then just continue with wat u are doin.. I suppose you can see how supportive your wife will be if you tell her that your job is affected by the economic downturn and your pay just got slashed 10%. If she agrees to reduce 10% of all expenses then you can use that to save towards a down payment for your house. It’s not nice to lie, but you need to think for the greater good. At this rate you will never be able to retire.. Wife sounds like a burden 🤔. I'm gona refrain from commenting on your relationship just because you are seeking purely financial advice and not relationship advice. 

You perhaps need to focus on earning more. Crazy? I know. But I realize a lot of financial advice is always around cutting back/saving and never on diversifying your income. 

See if you can fight for a better role or shift companies. Your take home pay should be increasing if you move jobs. If you can save up for 12 months (36k) you should be able to fund a businesses. You can secure loans as well with your income pretty easily. Something to look at perhaps.

You can cut back yes, but maybe temporarily to arm up and then deploy into other businesses that can do 2 things : 1. Buy back your time 2. Increase your MRR. 

Again. These are alternatives to having a frank discussion with your wife about cutting back expenditure. As someone who grew up in a very similar situation to you, I understand that sometimes coming from a place of lack can have the opposite effect from the scarcity mindset one may assume.. Bro ive posted my advice on the financial part of things.

But I'll post one more time cos there has been too much shit from many of the other post.

Ppl whom are not in your marriage shouldnt be posting as if they know your life based on a couple of paragraphs 🤣

So ignore the nastiness and the 'I know best and I have the perfect relationship' attitude yeah. All relationships are tough and NONE are perfect. 

So know that youre not alone. Cheers. I’m sorry to say this OP, but your wife still has that poor people mindset deeply ingrained in her. Yes, you can even give her RM20k/month, but with poor people mindset, that money will be gone in an instant and she wouldn’t even know what she used that money for. 

Design your life now. Decide what’s best for you and your family. The obvious one to correct is your family should live under the same roof. Your wife has no business staying in a different state than yours. She should pack up, leave her job (it’s probably not even a career) and stay with you and the kids. 

Whether you realize it or not, you hold the financial power in your family. You are practically the sole breadwinner. So use that power wisely, with fairness. That is - be fair to YOURSELF (important), your wife and the kids. 

Lay out that plan of yours to your wife, and communicate. If she can’t agree to your plan and don’t even want to discuss it, I’m sorry to say this, but you should find your way out.. After all those expenses, you still have extra RM3k per month…

RM3,000!

That’s a lot in my opinion. You can actually afford a decent place with that kind of instalment; it may not be a super mansion, but it’s something.

But we’re getting vibes that financial “issues” aren’t really the main issue for you right now. You seem to be going through a lot of things from what you wrote.. pompous fool. Widow her bro. Just 3k leftover liquid cash and you have a problem? I struggle to make 3k a month before expenses. 🙄. [deleted]. Best book to read is “Money Sober Money Drunk”. I'm in similar boat with you :( currently we are doing trials where me and my spouse separate our finance so that we can try to spend within our means. Does your wife earn RM7k that's why she spend that much? If so then seperating finance may help pressure her to reduce her spending, get her to still contribute to household spending that is proportional to her spend. E.g if she earns 30% of your salary she should contribute that much, then spend the rest of whatever remaining from her salary.. That is a lot of money. U are being a co dependent by allowing your wife and in laws to take advantage of u.

Take a look at the book, child hood poverty can lead to bad adulthood behaviour as like me having a poverty childhood it leads u to believe poverty os the way to be.. I'm really quite curious what would their reaction be if you say you got layoff from your job.. hire a financial advisor bruh. 7k every month? How does one spend that much, even for general groceries and stuff, 1k a month is enough for a family of 4.. how much savings do you have?. Your wife is the only daughter? No other siblings?. It is easy to FIRE if you make 500k USD per year. Not so much if you're making 120k USD per year living in High living cost area like san fran/nyc/boston etc. If I were you I would go cash with the wife expenses. No more cards.. First you have to tell us how much exactly you and your wife make separately (that gives the combined 28k). That will help us identify the who ought to spend less and where cuts should be made.. Coach your wife to buying mutual reits funds in the name for your children?. That love is gonna kill you some day. Good luck.. Bruh, I earn around 3.5k nett and my wife earns 1k more than me. I pay for food and all the necessities, including utilities and our child's nursery, while she covers the family insurance and occasional luxuries. I don't give her any allowances, let alone her parents, based on mutual understanding. 


I would be dead in a ditch somewhere if I were in your shoes. Communication is key.. [removed]. My recommendation is as follows :

#1 tell her the company decide to do salary reduction because of economic situation and your salary be reduced by 1k .
As such ask for some savings from her end 

#2 use the savings and save first before investing .
Not all investment makes money . Study on how to invest before investing .

#3 consider converting the rental to instalment . House is an asset you can own . Use your EPF for deposit and look at the opportunity to buy your own property . #1 above can help that .

#4 Consider weekend side gig from overseas . This could be via Fiverr or other Platforms. This could start you on your overseas income. Yikes, 7k wife expenses for a wife who is earning her own salary? I don't think can I can afford a "wife" anytime soon.. Idk bro but seems like about 50% of your expenses are related to your wife’s needs - her general expenses, her parents, her insisting in staying in that one state, etc. another 8k (children and student loan) are fixed so no way you can alter that. You can further cut your part but it’s too insignificant. I think you got your solution here like what others have pointed out.

Other option if negotiating with wife is not doable - just wait. Your student loan will be settled in couple of years, and idk your wife’s parents are probably not young anymore, you know…… start planning your finance from these events onwards.

Some Redditors pointed out your problem with insurance. Use that as a leverage to negotiate with your wife, cut down her expenses or move to where you live, and spend the amount saved in insurance. Can put some amount in those insurance saving plan (not a big fan of that but seems might be workable here for you), and cash out the amount at later time once it has passed the no-penalty threshold.. you know again, just to workaround with time factor and to move the money away from your wife. This pains my heart.

Talk to your wife to accommodate your commute at least. Live somewhere near. Relocate. Otherwise tell her to upgrade her skills and get better income.

Touch wood, if shit ever happened to you - they might ended up in Bersamamu!

You're not robot, you can't sustain the unnecessary stress thinking about work, traveling, money and quality time for eternity.. 7k for wife is kindda crazy imo. Perhaps u should talk to her about ur situation and ur plan to buy a house. Plan togather. Maybe even talk her into getting a full/part time job to reduce ur 7k into maybe 2-4k. With her job of 2-4k might help a little. Up ur savings into 5-10k range then u can start planning to own a fairly comfortable home.. Damn man, being a 35 y/o myself, it pains me reading this.

I think a lot has been said already. Just take action and don't let yourself down, don't let your parents down. They instilled money values in you from an early age to hopefully avoid situations like this.

The good thing is you're making what >90% of people here could only dream of making (myself included). Now it's time for you to sort out the other part of the equation. Your efforts now will be better spent on reducing expenses rather than increasing income.

Finally, 3k a month for saving/investing is still better than nothing, make good use of it. But need to increase that in the near future, 3k is what normally someone making 10k/month would save/invest.. Just curious, what does your wife spend the 7k on monthly?. 28k after income tax is a lot....not many people can earn that income.....now I understand  people say money is never enough. This is very true. Both partners' value about money must align, else shits gonna hit the fan sooner or later.

Alternatively you could be the 1 in a million who makes more money than she could spend. That would be the best in both worlds.. Yup, probably more info is needed on this. I do observe there is a separate budget for food and other shopping tho. So I'm wondering if the 7k expenses include things like bills, family groceries etc or just purely spending from your wife?. No, there are no secret savings, it's all spent, guaranteed.. Yeah everything else like food and living space already covered, 7k for personal stuff seems quite too much.. Exactly. 7k a month is too much. Try to have an honest and open conversation with your wife.

Then, pay down as much debt as possible before you start investing. 2k on food is also too much. Cut down on drinks. If you are able to spend <RM10 per meal it shouldn't exceed RM1500. 

And finally, RM2K for the weekly back and forth? Are you flying business class? This can definitely be cut down. I used to travel back and forth between Kedah and Penang every day and it didn't even cost half of the amount.. It really depends on their lifestyle. But in general the larger the human, the higher the costs.. Happy cake day!. OP, I saw some of your comments, and it's raising more red flags.


You mentioned that your in-laws thought "disciplining them means you don't love them". 

When you're apart from your children for period of time, you'll inherently lose some control towards raising & disciplining your children. Currently, they are raising your children the way they are raising your wife.


Please please, take back control before it's too late. Looks like your option now is to bring your wife & children to your state. Be a parent to your children. Don't leave them to grow as incapable individuals.

Again, prioritise what's best for your children.. Yes, a spouse can either 10x your income (like my siblings), or 0.2x it. Good angles, thanks so much.. This^ 

Communication is important. Understand each other then solve the problem together.. This has been done, and as you know I'm no stranger to see how it can work. However, our baselines aren't aligned and this makes it very hard for her.

1. E.g. I will be trying to save most income, but for her, a net 0 is enough. "ah, why are you worrying? It will be okay, there's a few ringgit left."
2. You will be surprised at how many spouses think that it's the norm for the other to do whatever it takes to put food on the table. It's in upbringing. Imagine a person growing up with zero boundaries, where disciplining them means you don't love them (e.g. my in laws will question my love for my kids when I teach them how to use cutleries which needs lots of repetition, so you can imagine how she was brought up). It will take a lot of therapy to change something ingrained in her for 25+ years.
3. As her parents never really grew up themselves, and are themselves incapable of having an adult conversation like you are suggesting (a level headed, rational discussion with an open heart that you may have to compromise on some decisions), it's a tall order to have such a conversation with her - she has no examples or baseline of doing so.. Yeah like wtf? I feel sad for op bro... such a good man. I understand the general view around that. But to be honest, she's really trying to cut down on things - but I'd say that issue here is that money habits seem to be very subconscious. Somehow, she cannot intuit certain things, like multiple small expenses add up to freaking large ones as it has been the norm of her upbringing. So if anything, I'd blame her parents for not bringing her up the right way.. Thanks, you are a great wife and from this comment I see that you possess a lot of self awareness. Unfortunately, things move a lot slower in their context. Changing mindsets and habits are easier when one has been brought up with certain values. Some parents are academically focus, some encourage kids to go into sports. But all have one trait, where the child learns to focus on a goal and relentless works at it for months or years. For my in laws, there has been no such thing. So baselines are vastly different.

For example, mastering a new skill might take a normal person 6 months to a year, and high flyers 1-3 months. But for a member of their family, it might take 5 years due to lack of discipline, consistency, and motivation. I normally see people around me pat themselves on the back when say, they become 2x better at something, but for them, that begins at 0.1x. And then it becomes very hard to sit down and say, I know you feel great about that, but there's actually some more room to go.. From the breakdown it feels like more than 50%. A blessing in disguise, honestly. Stay tough bro.. Well. It’s kinda too late for OP. He’s married
With kids. He’s lost. All the power is with his wife now. I’m curious about the gender of the his children. I hope is not both boys.. No worries, always here if you want to rant. Thanks!. Good for you actually 👍🏻. 300-400 for a dinner once in a while is fine. Average is overkill man. Wagyu A5 every dinner?. Unfortunately, her parents have nowhere else to go and nothing else to earn. They have no education and have no marketable skills (except say cooking?). I feel that they really will eat grass if we stopped funding them. They are also simple minded, old and immobile. That worries me a lot also, because a simple health issue would wipe my whole family out, but I try not to think about it.. Thank you, this has been the most reasonable comment yet. And thank you for not being all judgey on me. I realize I have made mistakes, and want to resolve them so I was fishing for ideas.

Your no.2 approach sounds perfect, and I didn't think about bringing in an advisor but now I will. I feel that the best thing here is to get an actual advisor, as bringing in my parents is a very sensitive issue. You see, although my parents came from B40, in my in laws perspective they are wealthy as that is their current state. As a result, there is an inferiority complex whenever something is suggested by my parents. For example, they did suggest self soothing techniques for children and to bring over some automated household devices they had in their house to mine, and boy, there was huge drama.. And that's not even the elephant in the room 😂

The wife must be living like the First Lady with that appalling amount of "wifey expenses". Considering the food expenses, education fees, diapers what not, infant accessories. Welllll..... Yeah, that's exactly how I have felt. Like I'm not living according to what I'm supposed to. I put this here to get a general feel of whether my situation is widely experienced (my parents combined earnings were less than 10k and yet they lived without much financial worries, surely what I'm experiencing is extreme?) and unfortunately it seems that it's an outlier.. Never underestimate the power of pussy. I was doing alright alone as my upbringing emphasized that. e.g. I saved more as a fresh grad then now. It's just that the current situation compromised a lot of my values.

Yes, convincing them to move closer to where I work has been tried, it's non-negotiable.. It feels like a survey for a drama storyline to see the reactions from random people. I'm so mad at his post to the point I don't feel sorry at all. What OP needs right now is not financial advice or relationship advice, he needs a freaking Superman to save him from this shitshow. Unless he decided to be a MAN, he's going to consider committing suicide soon. Mark my words.. Thanks for the input, that's exactly what I will do. Set a goal and projection and explain why X amount of savings is needed.. Yes, I recently asked and she has provided it and will have a sit down. She's actually not that bad if you live with her in person, just that her idea of money and her upbringing has made her subconsciously embrace certain habits.. My uncle faces the same situation as this guy. Have 2 kids and his ex-wife demand at least 5K for her "personal" expenditure. Turns out she cheated with a lowly-tier police officer and blame my uncle for her infidelity. In court, she lambasted my uncle because he lost his job during the pandemic and tk beri nafkah to her. She demands my uncle's house and a car for alimony.. Communication is key!. Too revealing if there are too many details but there are some liabilities that she took which bloated her expenses. For example, I paid off my car so I don't have that expense while she would have that. There are also other things that she took on like an aethetics expense. 

Yeah right? I know this comes as a culture shock to the community here due to the type of people it attracts, as it did for me.. I am super drained even with flying, as I have been doing it long term + have a demanding senior management role. I feel almost 10 years older than I am, despite being an athlete in my youth, so I'm quite afraid that I have nothing in the tank left for driving. 

Yes, I think food is something I can change. When I was single, I had the same 3 dishes everyday for months. Going to have to bring that back on the table.. Thanks for the rundown, really appreciate you taking the time and effort to streamline it.

No.4 is eye opening. I had no clue how much people gave to parents as I was brought up with the mentality that everybody should be self sufficient (I have no parents or even far relatives who need income for retirement, nor do I have sibings or cousins who give their parents monthly amounts except for one off medical emergencies where the sum is astronomical). His in laws also stays with him (if I understand it correctly). So food should be covered for them.. Very sound advice, thanks. I think she would be agree to be limited to the confines of her own income, but it will be harder to get her to share larger expenses like rental etc.. ikr. Thank you, one of the other high quality comments. The PF account suggest is golden, as I don't think she will want to dive into tracking every little expense just yet.. I'd love to, as I log every day myself. However, due to the huge cultural difference that would be the endgame. Like if she decides to log it the world must be ending. However, introductory stuff like reading would work better, so thanks for those recommendations!. Thanks, finally someone who understands how I truly feel.. Just curious, why are both you and OP letting your spouses have free reign over your money? Is it so hard to only let you spouse (assuming they are not working) access only a fixed amount of cash (reasonable amount) which could be a joint account with monthly auto transfers from your main account. If the issue is with credit cards, you could always use prepaid cards instead such as the new tng visa card or bigpay (alternatively you could drastically lower the card limit of the credit card your spouse is utilising).. Thanks, I was looking for advice like this. As for a better role, I'm always looking out but it seems that it's very hard to earn more than 25k in Malaysia. One could go into consulting but that would mean 0 time for my family for at least a few years, and my children are in their formative years. Any ideas on businesses that have an initial capex of around 36k? That's very doable for me.. Thanks bro. Yeah, seems that the nastier the comment, the less they have something that truly works in the real world. Either they are trolling or they have been emotionally affected by something from their own lives and are projecting it here. When people resort to bashing with emotion, it often means they are unhappy about that very same attribute within themselves. They see that "weakness" around them and it triggers a huge reaction. 

For example, one suggested to go thermonuclear against my wife without any form of finesse and tact. In almost all situations, that would backfire. Trying doing that even from a position of power and see what happens, whether you're the CEO of a company or the USA trying to "liberate" some city state. 

But you are worth listening to, so thank you.. Yes I am going through a lot, and those were my choices and my mistakes, so that's why I was just focusing on what to make of the RM amount.. Desperation can drive you to do some crazy stuff. Knowing I had a 5k loan coming back to Malaysia drove me to go all out at work, and take on any assignment no matter how tough/unrelated it was to my role.. No worries, I did expect all kinds of comments. Taking them with an open heart as I just wanted to see if the situation is common.. This is a shitty advice, regardless of love or whatsoever having that kind of saving will lead them to future conflicts, a ticking bomb to be exact. His children will eventually spend *more* than 3k as time goes by. The sooner they resolve this entire expenses debacle the better they can face the future as a family. 

Also, what the OP posted is not much of a relationship issue to be frank although it's apparent that his partner is the cause of the presented issue. OP just need some wake up call without further putting a blind eye on it.. Thanks, will look it up!. Thanks, will look up that book.. Do you know how much legit ones cost?. About 200k. Yes. She makes 8 and I make 20. Regarding point 1) I honestly don’t think lying is ever the answer. Honestly it could cause OP more stress and further strain their relationship. I would instead suggest OP to firmly control how much of OP’s salary can be accessed by his spouse, and if spouse is working get her to financially contribute towards some of the expenses such as rental, utility bills, child expenses and groceries.. Yes, insurance and other stuff is somewhere in there, I just rounded things up for simplicity. 

I agree that there's a great risk when it comes to what if it comes to a scenario where I'm unable to work or out of a job. I'd probably have to default on the educational loan.. RM230 per day must be spent to reach RM7k per month. It's hard to spend RM230 per day consistently for a month. Find out where the money is going, you might be surprised by the end of the money trail.. Spent on what? Beauty products? Clothes? Are there any items she can cut back on?. I'd like to believe OP has to travel west>east Msia or johor>penang, then it would be justified. Whereas on food 2k is just alright considering he definitely earns above 10k. Purely my opinion. Its the other parts that need rectifying.... Thanksss. Ai. ..talk is easier than do....sorry to tellyou that bro. You need to be a bit more firm. Your wife is like my husband. My husband doesn’t really care about money and say we have enough. While I’m a bit more planner, achiever and love saving. So we have split account that we keep ourselves and joint account where we put money both of us. Those money in joint account go towards mortgage, bills, groceries, vacation. So I don’t touch his private money and he doesn’t touch mine. But we both know that if we need more we can dip into our own savings. I’m firm on my decisions and I told my husband that I was grew up poor so I want to be able not to worry about my old time. He understands it. We reached a solution we both want.

Edit: my mom spends money like crazy so I stopped giving her money and told her I’ll keep it until when she needs it or when her own money runs out.. Tell her that you want to buy a house and leave something for your children. Any good wife should be able to comprehend that.. When I was reading your post it sounds like you're either blinded in love or in delusion. 

But it's clear that you have complete understanding of where the fundamental issue lies. Your partner (and her family) is unfortunately the issue, and it doesnt sound like she is willing to budge because their worldview is just too different.

Whatever it is, I hope you can overcome this hurdle because renting a room with roommates with a personal income of what I assume is around 20-24k is not ideal. You deserve better OP. Yikes. Sounds like the financial issues are merely a symptom of the more serious relationship/behavior issues. 

Honestly, you are bending over backwards to give her a lifestyle that she has dictated. What happens when you try to push back on some of these, frankly, absurd lifestyle requests?. Likewise. I hope OP have the strength and courage to put his foot down and start cutting those unnecessary expenses.. Blame her parents for her (and by correlation, your )- scenario?

Wake up, both of you are adults. Adults take ownership / responsibility of their own lives, make plans for what they need to do to get to where they want to be, and take action accordingly. 

Who agreed to the decision to be with your wife as a life partner - thus binding the two of you legally and financially? Who agreed to the decision to move back to MY (when you know the conversion rate is shit and you have commitments in USD?) Who agreed to the decision to create 2 kids and bring them into this world? Who agreed to two rents in two separate states? Unless she held you at gunpoint at every decision, you’re equally implicated in this position.

Blaming others for your own situation is for little kids who have no agency or control over their lives.. I understand that op. It pains me to cut off some finances to my parents too. We fought a lot abt it. But once they see me changing, they want to change as well. My mother now actively invest whats left of her retirement but I say my father still the same. It is what it is. 

However, I did change. And I changed so much that saving a mere 10k a year is no longer a problem for us. I am also the same age as you op, so 10k savings a year is nothing for my friends, but it is something for me and my husband. If you decide to go on this route, it is a super long journey and learning to change is incredibly hard when you taste money and freedom of not working so much to get there (as you as the husband provides very well). 

I did became self aware after meeting a unit trust/insurance agent. When the agent did the retirement calculation and my husband & I am way way behind. Whatever he saved, I spent. Anyway I was so scared that we might not have anything much in our 50s and it is so common nowadays. 

I really hope things work for you, cz I remember my husband being so sad while explaining to me (but I was angry lol). It did end up good. Take care op!. Jap bbqs. Trying out new restaurants. Alcohol was the killer. Probably i was in denial i could handle it, till it really set me back from important goals (moving out, new car, investments). 

Lesson learned, date people who can give you additional value. Not to supplement their lifestyle. I hope i can stick by it haha. You need to learn a way to handle in law. I got a few ways as I’m used with my mom. If they demand something, just nod and say yes. But don’t do it. Who cares. Just put them off from nagging and don’t let their words linger for long. Lie if you have to. Just yeah yeah and later later okay gtg. Be nice but lie more. Say no more money or whatever. Just don’t agree to their demand much. Please don’t let in laws dictate what goes in and out of your home. It’s your home.. After reading a lot of your replies I think I can see a theme here. It's your lack of financial responsibility. What do I mean by that, if you are the one making the real money it's upon you to take the control of how to spend it. At this point since you are the provider for your wife inlaws and kids you should be the one taking the important decisions. Imagine yourself as the clan leader that everyone is following. Some decisions might sound like this, move your wife and inlaws with you, close to your work. Save money and cover your student loan ASAP. Same money for a down payment for a house. Now the trick is this, let them handle the details but you need to set up the direction, for example, let them decide what house you will purchase, townhouse/condo/bedrooms but they need to understand that you need to save money from your income to pay for it. Also, a fundamental problem is how You negociate this things, from what I can tell you easily give in to their demands which is your problem, you need to stay put and hold on to your demands they will give in eventually as you control the inflow of money you have the control but up until now you just gave away this control. Good luck. I believe sometimes people spend money recklessly because they have no long term financial goal. You need to prepare an excel spreadsheet and show her that if you all can save xx amount a month, how much does that equate to in a year? And how much would that equate to in 20 years. Show her the power of compounding. Put that financial goal in your bedroom or somewhere that you both can visually see everyday. Also subtly change her mindset. Watch YouTube videos on personal finance when she's around. Don't force her to watch. But slowly by slowly, hopefully her mindset will change.. The inferiority complex is so true man. This happens everywhere.. You dont have a money issue, you have a wife issue. Good luck. Blinded by the pussy. In a healthy relationship, there should be no such thing as "non-negotiable" between husband and wife when it comes to family matters. Everything should be negotiated and compromised to the benefit of the family as a whole. So the root cause of your entire problem is an unhealthy relationship with your wife. However, as you mentioned in another comment, you're not looking for relationship advice, you're looking for finance advise, which I doubt will get you far because it is not the root cause, it will merely be a patchwork fixing the symptom. Go fix your relationship.. Good luck I guess ... make the same amount of money from home.. Couldn't find the other comment that you left but just wanted to say you're still young! You can turn things around still. But only you can figure out the solutions to your predicaments, and I believe you eventually would.. Bruh but here ranting about it.. U in denial. this is just so sad… hearts out to your uncle, hopefully he can turn it around and live a more fulfilling life.. Oof please tell me the alimony demand didnt get through.. Wow looks like botox and the likes are in play too.. Please please explain this to your wife. She has to know how it is negatively affecting you. And for the love of God do not downplay your suffering. She has to know, and if she understands but doesn’t care both of you need couples counselling more than a financial advisor…. Seems like you have certain skills or expertise that makes you very very valuable. If you were to go overseas, you could potentially make double your current salary. Might tempt the missus to leave her home town to live overseas?. As i said, if he cant tahan then need to sit down and communicate.

And the reason why i said this is not a good place to seek for rs advice is because a few reply advice op to cut ties with his SO haha.

My apologies if it came out the wrong way.. about rm3000-rm4000. Then it's kind of justified that she spends 7k on herself and 2k on her parents but tell her she should reduce one of them by 1k since she is outspending by 1k. Of course she should also contribute to the kids' expenses and rent but that will be a second step.. No harm to tell the truth but see what works . Different stokes different folks . Sometimes need some event for the behaviour change to happen .. All your problems will be solved if you just sat your wife down and got her to listen. This isn't a personal finance issue, this is a maritial issue. I totally understand this r/raisedbynarcissists mentality, but that is really your only solution. It's not like you're not bringing in enough already.

You need to treat this as a maritial issue, go to counselling etc. Not a personal finance issue. The silver lining is that this isn't an economic consideration, which is generally impossible to solve. Godspeed.. Buddy, no one should live like that. If you are not in control of your money you are not in control of anything.

I feel bad for you man. Hope things turn around for you.. LV bags and designer clothes can easily hit that. Skill issue. I bet even using La Mer would not cost that much. I'll say it: affair. You seemed good at managing money 💰 I used to save first. Then only the spend the  balance.. That's reasonable, my parents did so for us, so why can't I?. There's a reason I was asking for financial advice, not relationship advice. I take ownership for this situation, and the question was to fish for ideas on what to do with the net income that I have left, and how to possibly cut down expenses. 

This comment blames parents, for sure, but it was my intention to soften the blow that people in general had on my spouse. The intention was to say: what's done is done, she was brought up like that, and now what do we have left in the toolbox?. This needs to be higher up lol. Dude is unfortunately on massive copium, this is both a relationship and financial issue. Yes, so you feel my disappointment in life, since you also believe I should be disappointed in myself for every choice I have made up till now, which I am. I can't tell you how much regret I live with every single waking moment.. I’m astonished that his resentment seems to be channelled toward his siblings and begrudging them by his statements like 

How his siblings are ‘working fat cat jobs like typical Ivy League grads’ ‘spend 20k like it’s nothing’ ‘who cares about financial responsibility when you’re earning half a million out of uni’ 

His siblings made better decisions, backed up with discipline and consistently over time and actions.

I don’t think his siblings are the ones he should be expanding energy on here.. Maybe so, but my post was targeted toward what to do with remaining savings, and what to do in cutting costs, not about specifically spouse. The comments section was where it turned that way.. It is quite complicated. It is not easy to accuse someone of "zina" in syariah court. How my uncle found out? Through whatsapp and his kids. The ex-wife brought the kids to the police officer place to sleep with. They are still fighting in court and all of our family pray that she gets nothing from our uncle. But like I said its hard to have a proof of someone doing zina and if my uncle is the one to jatuh talak then he automatically have to pay alimony. So thats that. This experience made me think not to have a marriage. There is no incentive for man these days to get married. Todays marriage is a glorified prostitution. The court are against man.. Thanks, going to put every effort into 2023 to make it work. Because you're a doormat. That's what I am learning about you from this entire post and your replies.. Assuming your wife is not above 60 years old hence is incapable of changing, blaming the way her parents raised her when she could take a step forward to change things herself is not the way to go. The moment we reached adulthood, the blame game on parents should stop. 

This is not an advice per se, but you know deep down what you need to do to dig yourself out of the situation.. Brother, I don’t think this is a financial advice issue though. It seems that you don’t have the capability to challenge your wife and make the necessary decisions which seems like a deep rooted relationship issue. Stop being yes man and challenge her when needed (challenging doesn’t have to be filled with rage, be toxic or condescending. Patience, proper explanation and solid understanding of the other parties views and values is the key here), relationships are built on trust and compromises but it seems that you are the only one compromising.. Man, ignore all these haters just trying to kick a man while he’s down. Mistakes were made, to be sure, but wallowing in regret is not a useful exercise. It is definitely possible to survive on less than half what you’re spending now, but you need to be able to make your wife understand that while living in a specific state might seem non-negotiable, spending more than you earn (which it sounds like you’re one expensive incident away from hitting) is actually non-negotiable. 

You need to have that discussion, however your wife needs to hear it and understand it, even if it’s facilitated by a counselor. I feel your frustration, OP, and I hope you can figure out a tenable way forward.. Regret is fine. Continuing going down a road you are already regretting - that's pretty much on you. Either you change your perspective and be content with what you have or get out of this situation man. My siblings took the path I suggested to them. I wrote their admission essays, prepared them for job interviews, and was deep in every career plan they had. I envy them, because they took my decisions and it paid off, while I stupidly made the decisions I made for "puppy love" and am now literally paying for it.

The bulk of resentment is still toward myself for being so stupid. There is no depth of how bad one can feel for knowing a sure path to a good life, guiding others to it, and never being able to live it oneself.

So I assure you that no amount of bashing you do can make me feel worst.. Cutting cost = ur wife and her family already took up a large chunk of ur income.. Understand that it's non negotiable for a lot of things but that's a decision u made yourself. It sucks earning big bucks but having to save on food and your own accommodation (rent room to cut cost), so tbh to keep ur sanity I'd suggest use the balance 3k "savings" to splurge on urself mate.. 😮‍💨 so sad. I genuinely feel bad for your uncle.. Upvoting this for speaking the blunt truth!. Not just a doormat, he's an ostrich burrowing his head into the ground to avoid the real issue; his wife's inability to spend within means. 

He can hustle to earn more, but no point when the wife only knows how to spend it all.. Yeah. Financial advice would intertwine with life advice. I have a problem with money too until I live on my own and eat instant noodles and some bun for a week or so. My guess is that the wife never have the chance to live independently.. Many men are in this situation. I saw a lot of cases in court where the wife goes hoeing while their spouse works his ass off to feed the family. The sad part is all the wives blame the guy. Imagine you work to provide for your family to give them a good house and food only to be cheated on. Worse, if you break the marriage you are liable to alimony. Technically speaking the man needs to pay for the divorce.. Yeah although my wife and I is also long distance at the moment, but at least I can trust her to not go and hoe around. It is because of this type of hoe behaviour thats why we have MGTOW movement. Do you know what the ex-wife said? She said she cheated because my uncle is not religious enough. Like what! No sense of accountability. This woman has no sense of accountability. Don't know how to cook? Because her husband doesn't provide her with the kitchen like her friend's husband's in ig. Don't know how to manage the house? Because the house is not big enough like her friends in ig. The morning after wake up ig, ws and gossiped with friends. Evening scroll Facebook and shopee until late at night. Complain this and that. When my uncle stood a firm decision said he is dayus and threatened to bruise herself and accuse my uncle of hitting her and publish on FB. Went to my uncle's lawyer said this is normal for a man to experience. Most divorce court cases are toxic women wanting to ruin their husband's life. Only not publicized due to the theory of a man have to be a gentleman.. Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit this beetch is not even for the street. She is for the deepest hell that one could go. Manipulative gaslighting straight up evil. I hope justice prevails for your uncle.. Even my aunt who is a strong feminist said this bitch has to go down. Not all woman is good. This incident made our family more resilient though. My uncle is a good guy type dengar cakap mak ayah type so seeing him depressed made us realize if you fuck with one of us you fuck with all of us. Reduced expenses car insurance policy.  Is there such plans as Pay-per-Mile plans car insurance policy in Malaysia? It will be great for people like me who don’t drive so often. At least I can  save on car insurance expenses.. Etiqa has a DRIVE LESS SAVE MORE feature. Basically set it up. Take picture of your odometer and car number plate. Upload via the app. You get some sort of cashback or refund.

Not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for.. Check out promilej, they have quite similar benefits too!. Etiqa, Pacific and Orient (Promilej), RHB Insurance have it. Etiqa requires fairly frequent check-ins on the app and picture uploads of your odometer to ensure you're not driving beyond your mileage. The rebate is given back to you in the form of cashback 

Promilej and RHB have upfront discounts, but if you happen to have a claim and you've driven past your mileage, you have to pay a part of your claim. chubb insurance has it too. Yup I can vouch for this. Haven’t heard of other insurance companies offering this.. Been using that earlier this year, so far got approx RM110 cash rebate. Pretty neat. I'm just finishing up an article on this. It's a free add-on for both existing users upon renewal or new users. Seems super easy with their app, uploading a pic of your plate and odometer to start.. This is awesome! I barely reached <10,000km in 6 months so this would be great.

How to set it up though? Will renew my car insurance for the first time in Dec 2022. Can i just request to change to this one?. I quite like their policy renewal flexibility. For the past 2 months I've been WFH, so I opt not to renew just yet. Its just exactly what I need.. May i know how does the upfront discount that you mentioned works?. How does it works?. I'm getting around RM3 rebate each month, I drive around 15km/day.. Do you mean all of the policies mentioned in here? It would be great if you could link me the article for better understanding.. for promilej, you can goggle P&O insurance.. Promilej rebate discounts are instant as well compared to Etiqa where you have to wait a certain period of time before getting back your money.. Basically you pick your mileage upfront.
So say you only intend to drive 5000 km per year, you select that, then they give you a 30% discount. (Example only)

If you intend to drive 10000km per year, then you get a 20% discount. (Example only)

But! If you bang your car and drove above that mileage at the time of the claim, you pay that % on your claim. So say you pick the 5000 km plan and got 30% discount on RM 1000. You only pay RM700 for your insurance.

But if you got into an accident, and they saw you drove 9000km, which is more than the 5000 km plan you picked,, you have to pay 30% of your claim. I.e. if damages are RM2000, you have to pay 30% of that i.e. RM600 on the claim. 

This is just a broad example...read your policy fine print carefully!. as far as i remembered, you have to key in the current reading of your odometer

then you select a plan based on the number of kilometers you intend to use, with the smaller plan going for lower premium

I'm not sure when it'll be published but I'll leave a link here when it is. Or you could also just check on their website.. God this can be the premise of Rainmaker 2

Total 23400. Okay now i know where my money flow to.. People do monthly haircuts? til. That actually sounds like pretty good budgeting for a family of 3 👌🏼. your wife dont work ?. Wew… How much do you earn lah brader?. How can someone live in their car? Is it legal? Safe?. Wowww you must be earning big bucks 😁. Just curious what kind of insurance are you taking for it to be that high?. your insurance is too high. No entertainment? Also, thoughts on not having insurance? I’m 25 this year and haven’t gotten insurance either. This is really impressive. Kudos to you!. Bawse. Far from it, respectfully. If i remove travel, I would say averagely my expenses including food and day to day entertainment to be around 6k per month, granted I do have my food expenses heavily reduced as I am still staying with my parents, am single and have no dependants.. Amlife : RM200/month  
AXA Life+Medical : 155/month  
Tokio Marine Med : 280/month 

I rounded to closest 50. Better to be overinsured than underinsured, I guess. Though i hope the day i will ever need to use it to never come.. For entertainment I just use Youtube and since I like to draw, I draw a lot digitally and on scrap paper like receipts xD

If your company provide insurance, then you're good. 
But my company don't, so I will just make sure I don't do any risky activities (hiking etc), and just stick to simple exercise to keep me healthy. I also eat healthily (no instant noodles, no fried food, make sure I get my micro and macronutrients). And since I don't drive or take any transport, I have minimal risk for accidents. When I walk, I will triple look around and be aware of my surroundings, and carry huge umbrella to keep me safe. I don't travel as well. 

The only reason I don't take insurance is because my dad used to take for us, and he said paying for premium is even more expensive than going the doctor yourself. So I just saved the money and will use it just in case I need it for medical purpose.. Have you tried the EPF iLindung?. With all due respect, excluding travel how do you rack up to RM6K/month on food and entertainment if you’re living with your parents while being single? 😅. May I know why you have multiple insurance? Sorry, I am slightly unclear about insurance.. Thanks for the info. I thought it was for one medical card. Now that makes sense.. Great insight, thanks for sharing!. Though I do live with my parents, I eat out with friends at times, especially supper and weekend nights. For example, my dinner last night is close to RM200 per pax so 3k a month for food is really not that much of a stretch since I often volunteer to pick up the tab.. Hmm, tbh i dont know why either, 2 of those are signed up by my parents before I turned 18 (10 years ago) so I just continued paying, just recently sign up AXA due to how cheap it was.. You're most welcome :). Kudos to you for volunteering to pick up the tab. You’re a great friend! ✌🏼. Was about to ask why do you have two medical cards. Then have you ever claimed anything? Currently I pay for my own medical card but also got company's but I see no reason to close my own since I am planning to jump ship within a year.. Honestly, I dont have a good answer. I have it just because I signed up a new one and too lazy to cancel the old one, thus currently paying for both. The old one (signed by my parents) only cover up to 100k so I feel its insufficient thus I signed 1 more which covers up to 1 mil. I also have company medical card under AIA but i believe that covers only up to 25k .. What are your monthly expenses?. Keen to know what your monthly expenses are...

I'll start with some of mine. Feel free to add of your fixed monthly expenses :)
